<small>AND</small><br />

FORTUNE-TELLER.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="THE_GOLDEN_WHEEL_OF_FORTUNE">THE GOLDEN WHEEL OF FORTUNE.</h2>


<p>This singular wheel was much consulted in the middle ages, and
is said to have been used by Cagliostro to aid him in his divinations.
I have selected it from an old Latin manuscript on Astrology, and
translated it into English for the benefit of those of my readers who
cannot read the former language. <span class="smcap">See Frontispiece.</span></p>


<h3>THE GOLDEN WHEEL OF FORTUNE SHOWS:</h3>

<ul><li>I. <i>Whether you shall obtain the favor of the person you desire?</i></li>

<li>II. <i>If the querent shall meet with the preferment he wisheth for?</i></li>

<li>III. <i>Whether a sick person will recover?</i></li>

<li>IV. <i>If the said sickness will be long or short?</i></li>

<li>V. <i>Shall your expectation or wish succeed?</i></li>

<li>VI. <i>If it is good for you to marry, or otherwise?</i></li>

<li>VII. <i>Whether the friendship of a certain person will prove advantageous
or not?</i></li>

<li>VIII. <i>Whether a person shall be rich or poor? etc., etc.</i></li>
</ul>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>HOW TO TELL FORTUNES BY THE GOLDEN WHEEL.</h3>

<p>The person whose fortune is to be told, must place the wheel of
Fortune face downward, prick into a number (it is better to do it
with their eyes shut), then refer for an explanation, which stands at
the corresponding number as that you pricked into. (See Frontispiece.)</p>

<p><i>The following observations answer for either sex, the party, therefore,
trying this wheel, must alter wife for husband, or just as the answers
may suit either party.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>1. If this number is fixed upon, it assures the person that you will
marry an homely person, but rich.</p>

<p>2. Whatever your intentions are, for the present, decline them.
Those absent will return.</p>

<p>3. Shows loss of friends; bad success at law; loss of money; unfaithfulness
in love.</p>

<p>4. If your desires are extravagant, they will not be granted; but
mind how you make use of your fortune.</p>

<p>5. Very good fortune; sudden prosperity; great respect from high
personages; a letter bringing important news.</p>

<p>6. Look well to those who owe you money, if ever so little, a letter
of abuse may be expected.</p>

<p>7. Your lover will act constant and true toward you.</p>

<p>8. A friend has crossed the sea, and will bring home riches, by
which you will be much benefited.</p>

<p>9. A loving partner; success in your undertakings; a large and
prosperous family.</p>

assistance he is likely to live in middling circumstances.</p>

<p>11. A very sudden journey, with a pleasant fellow-traveller, and
the result of the journey will be generally beneficial to your family.</p>

<p>12. You may regain that which you have lost with great perseverance
and trouble.</p>

<p>13. A letter of importance will arrive, announcing the death of a
relative for whom you have no very great respect, but who has left
you a legacy.</p>

<p>14. By venturing carefully, you will gain doubly, though you will
suffer great privation.</p>

<p>15. You will meet with many crosses before you are comfortably
settled.</p>

<p>16. Too sudden acquaintance with the opposite sex; but which
will be opposed; notwithstanding the party should persevere, as it
will be to his or her advantage.</p>

<p>17. An agreeable partner, a good temper, and a large family of
children.</p>

<p>18. Let the chooser of this number persevere; for your schemes
are good, and must succeed.</p>

<p>20. Your lover may be low in circumstances, but affectionate.</p>

your attentions to.</p>

<p>30. You love one who is affectionate and true, and deserves respect.</p>

<p>31. You too fantastically refuse offers. Be prudent when you accept,
or you will be sorry.</p>

<p>32. You will be very unfortunate for a short time, but be careful,
and your situation will very soon alter.</p>

<p>33. A fortune will be yours, but be not over anxious.</p>

<p>34. Alter your intentions, or you will be sorry when it is too late.</p>

uncomfortably.</p>

<p>36. You will have a sober, steady, and affectionate partner, but
poor.</p>

schemes will be successful.</p>

<h2 id="WHAT_ARE_DREAMS">WHAT ARE DREAMS?</h2>


<p>I offer you in this work, my dear reader, all that can be collected
in reference to dreams. Notwithstanding the proverbial saying,  “All
dreams are lies,” we frequently see the realization of them, and by
them we are informed of more or less interesting events which afterward
happen to us. A prudent and enlightened man will therefore
examine carefully his dreams to know which he ought to interpret,
neglecting those which are extravagant because of too exalted an
imagination or of a disturbed digestion.</p>

<p>In consulting this book with attention, in seeking in it for the explanation
of your dreams, and calculating the causes which have produced
them, you will rarely depart from the truth, because you will
be following the rules of a wise combination, which will prevent you
from falling into an illusory if not fatal error.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3><a name="FOREKNOWLEDGE_OR_INTERPRETATION" id="FOREKNOWLEDGE_OR_INTERPRETATION">FOREKNOWLEDGE, OR INTERPRETATION
OF DREAMS.</a></h3>


<p>In the Holy Scriptures God says, that he  “will pour his Spirit on
all flesh, that the young men and maidens shall prophesy, the old
men shall see visions, and the young men dream dreams.” Both
sacred and profane history are full of so many examples of the fulfilment
of dreams, that he must be very skeptical and but little versed
in natural science who would refuse to have faith in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Hippocrates says that when the body is asleep the soul is awake,
and transports itself everywhere, where the body would be able
to go, that it knows and sees all that the body could know or see
were it awake; that it touches all the body could touch, in a word,
that it performs all the actions that the body of a sleeping man could
do were he awake.</p>

<p>There are five kinds of dreams, differently named according to their
different qualities. The first is dream, the second vision, the third
oracle, the fourth revery, and the fifth apparition.</p>

<p>A dream is that which, while we are asleep, shows us the truth
hidden under certain figures, as when Joseph interpreted to king
Pharaoh the dream concerning the seven lean kine that devoured
the seven fat ones; the dream of the seven full ears of corn, etc.</p>

<p>A vision is simply a dream happening when the body is awake
instead of sleeping, as Vespasian when he saw the surgeon who had
extracted Nero’s tooth.</p>

<p>The oracle is a revelation, or information given us by some angel
or other celestial spirit who does God’s bidding. The angel appearing
to Joseph the husband of the Virgin, and to the wise men, are
examples of this.</p>

<p>Revery occurs when the passions are so vehement that they destroy
the mental equilibrium for a time. Then what one thinks of
during the day he will dream of at night, as a lover who has been
thinking during the day of his beloved one will continue to do so at
night while he is sleeping. Sometimes when one fears to meet a
person, he will dream at night that he has met him; having fasted
during the day, he will dream of eating, or, having been thirsty, of
drinking. Avarice will make the miser dream of his gold, and speak
of it when sleeping, as he would not do when awake.</p>

<p>Apparition is named Phantom by the Greeks, and is only that
nocturnal vision sometimes presented to children and weak-minded
persons, who imagine they see objects presented to intimidate or pain
them.</p>

<p>Of these five kinds of dreams, the three first have an appearance
of truth, but the last two are absolutely false.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked, with regard to all dreams, that those of which
only parts are remembered, signify nothing at all; that those that
memory retains are good and true; that they ought to occur about
day-break, or at least after midnight, because until that time the
senses and the body are occupied in the labor of digestion, and the
mind disturbed by the remembrance of dinner, can dream of nothing
reasonable. Nevertheless Artemidorus says, that a sober, temperate,
and tranquil man can dream at any hour of the night, or even during
the day, and that the fulfilment of such dreams will be certain.</p>

<p>Some authors divide dreams into three kinds, namely, dreams of
natural objects, of animals, and of celestial objects. The natural
things are those by which physicians judge of the temperament;
dreams of animals show the passions and cares that the mind has
felt during the day; those of celestial objects are the intimations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
divine things, as for example, the statue that the king of Babylon
saw when asleep, which is so well explained by the prophet Daniel.</p>

<p>There are few persons who have the gift of dreaming that which will
be fulfilled, fewer still who know how to interpret them, because it is
necessary to observe many things not generally known.</p>

<p>There are two principal kinds of dreams, the speculative or contemplative,
and the allegorical or significative. To these one ought
to pay attention, the speculative happening in the fulfilment as it
occurred in dreams, for example: A prisoner in a small prison at
Paris dreamed that a cord was being attached to his neck to hang
him, that after it was done a stranger appeared with a sword who
severed the cord and delivered him from death; this was fulfilled the
next day, for the judge having pronounced his sentence, and given
him to the hangman, he was delivered by unknown persons employed
by his friends. Allegorical dreams on the contrary never happen as
one has dreamed. Thus, to dream of an angel, signifies revelation
or good news, but to see a serpent which tries to bite one signifies
troubles arising from the envy of others.</p>

<p>Speculative dreams are soon fulfilled, allegorical ones not so quickly;
a day or two often intervening between the dream and its completion.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF
DREAMS.</h3>

<p>“Dreams? Nonsense!” I hear some grave-faced person cry. Indeed!
And where did this grave-faced person learn his wisdom? Not from experience, I will engage. No, experience teaches us the
reverse of this. Dreams are <i>by no means</i> nonsense. This I maintain
openly in the face of all the world.</p>

<p>I maintain even that <i>every dream has its signification</i>. Not that it
always discloses the future, I am far from asserting that. I say only
it <i>has its signification</i>. Commonly a dream "permits us to cast a
glance into the soul or into the heart of man. The thoughts which
dwell in the former, and the feelings which sway the latter, shape
themselves in sleep into various images, which throw a strong light
upon the character. There have no doubt been many extravagant
fictions palmed off as facts relative to dreams, but yet enough credible
evidence exists of their importance to make any strange dream the
subject of reflection and examination on the part of the dreamer; and
it cannot be denied that many things in our dreams are actually
omens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A List of Dreams, with their True Interpretation, together
with the Lucky Numbers of the Lottery which they signify.</span></h4>

<p><a id="ABOVE"></a>ABOVE. To dream you see any thing hanging <i>above</i> you signifies
you will improve in your worldly prospects, and soon be in a better
situation than you were before you had the dream. 76, 62, 14.</p>

<p><a id="ABSENCE"></a>ABSENCE. To dream of absent persons, signifies that they will
soon return. It also denotes success in business. 4, 22.</p>

<p><a id="ABSCESS"></a>ABSCESS. If you dream you have an abscess, or running sore on
your person, it foretells good fortune and good health, to be preceded
by sickness. 3, 27.</p>

<p><a id="ABUSE"></a>ABUSE. To dream that you are abused and insulted, is a sign that
some dispute will happen between you and some person with whom
you have business; if you are in love, be assured that some one has
attempted to injure you with the object of your affections, and that
they have in a great measure succeeded. 6, 38, 44.</p>

<p><a id="ABUNDANCE"></a>ABUNDANCE. If you dream you have an over-abundance of any
thing, it goes by contrary, and is a sign of a scarcity; as if a farmer
should dream that he had a great crop, it would predict a scarcity—not
perhaps of that particular article of which he dreamed, but of
something that would be important to him. 15.</p>

<p><a id="ABYSS"></a>ABYSS. To see an abyss, or deep hole, is a warning; avoid, after
such a dream, taking a journey by land, or a voyage by sea, for eight-and
forty hours, because it forebodes accidents by travelling. 62, 19.</p>

<p><a id="ACCIDENT"></a>ACCIDENT. To dream that an accident has happened to you, or
to any one of your household, or with whom you live, foretells that
you will see some one whom you little expect to see. 72, 3, 11.</p>

<p><a id="ACCOUNTS"></a>ACCOUNTS. Dreams that relate to making up accounts are good
omens. If you dream you found an error in your money account, it
foretells that you will have a piece of good luck. Accounts blotted
with ink is a sign of sickness. 14.</p>

<p><a id="ACCUSE"></a>ACCUSE. To dream a person accuses you of any thing, is favorable
to the dreamer. 66, 4.</p>

<p><a id="ACORN"></a>ACORN. (<i>See <a href="#OAK">Oak</a>.</i>) To dream you see swine eating acorns denotes
that you will have reverses in business, and lose if you are not very
careful; to dream of picking acorns signifies that a rich relative will
leave you a fortune. 65.</p>

<p><a id="GUTTER"></a>GUTTER. If you dream of lying in a gutter, or of seeing a man so
reclining, it foretells that some honor awaits you, or some one in
whose success you take an interest. If a girl dreams of a broken
gutter, she should be careful of allowing her lover to be too familiar
with her person, or some accident may happen. 27, 65.</p>

<p><a id="HACK"></a>HACK. (<i>See <a href="#CARRIAGE">Carriage</a>.</i>) If you see, in your dream, a row of hacks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
or carriages at a funeral, it shows that you’ll soon attend a wedding
or a jolly party. 32, 19.</p>

<p><a id="HAIL"></a>HAIL. To dream of a hail-storm, is a sign that you will make a
good bargain, or will be lucky in some undertaking, provided the hail
is white or in crystals; black hail, denotes sorrow and death, therefore
you should never dream of that kind of hail if you can help it.
To dream of seeing white hail lying on the ground intimates that
you’ll soon get plenty of cash in some transaction. 21, 72.</p>

<p><a id="HAIR"></a>HAIR. If you dream that your hair is thick and bushy, it shows
that you’ll grow rich or powerful; if you dream it is curly and kinky,
when in fact it is not, it is a sign you’ll do something that you will
afterward be ashamed of; if, in your dream, you imagine that your
hair has fallen off, or that it has become extremely thin, it is a bad
omen, as it shadows forth sickness, and perhaps death. 42.</p>

<p><a id="HAM"></a>HAM. Dreaming of fine-looking hams is a good omen; but if they
are wormy or in any way blemished, it spoils all the luck, and shows
that you will be unfortunate. To dream of eating fine-tasting hams
is a sign that you will do something noted that will create a talk,
but all in your favor; if the ham that you eat is bad and wormy, the
said talk will be a scandal against you. 30, 1.</p>

<p><a id="HAMMER"></a>HAMMER. To dream that you see or hear hammering, denotes
thrift to some one of your friends; if you are using the hammer yourself,
it shows that you will be fortunate. A hammer is a good article
to dream about. 3.</p>

<p><a id="HAND"></a>HAND. If you dream that your right hand is injured, or any thing
is the matter with it, it shows that you will soon be called upon to
assist a friend in distress; if it is your left hand, assistance will be
solicited from you for an unfortunate stranger. 22, 78.</p>

<p><a id="HANGED"></a>HANGED. (<i>See <a href="#EXECUTION">Execution</a>.</i>) To dream of being hanged is an excellent
omen, as it foretells that you will become either rich or distinguished.
If you dream you are going to be hanged, it is nearly as
good, as it betokens success in all your undertakings; but should
you imagine that you eluded the officers of the law and escaped,
that is a bad omen, as it foretells disappointment and ill-luck.
The theory of such dreams is, that they always work by contraries.
10, 7, 6.</p>

<p><a id="HARP"></a>HARP. To dream you play upon the harp, indicates that you have
some envious enemies who seek to injure you with slander. To
dream you hear any person play upon the harp, is a sign that if you
have sick friends they will recover. In love affairs this dream is
very lucky. 5, 11.</p>

<p><a id="HARVEST"></a>HARVEST. To dream of a harvest field is a good omen. If you
dream you are working in one it indicates success in business. To
lovers, this is one of the most fortunate signs; to a young man, it
signifies he will wed a rich and beautiful bride; to a young maiden,
it is a sign she will soon be engaged to the object of her affections;
to the married, it signifies domestic bliss. 4, 11, 44.</p>

<p><a id="HASTE"></a>HASTE. (<i>See <a href="#RUN">Running</a> and <a href="#WALKING">Walking</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="HAT"></a>HAT. For a man to dream he has got a new hat shadows forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
good luck and advancement; dreaming of an old or shabby hat is a
sign he will soon fall in love; and if he dreams he is wearing such a
hat, the omen is not so favorable, for he will probably endeavor to
take improper liberties with his sweetheart and be successful. 21, 6.</p>

<p><a id="HATCHING"></a>HATCHING. To dream of hatching fowls of any kind is a sign of
thrift; if you imagine, in your dream, that a hen comes off with a
very large brood of chickens, it shadows forth so much cash to be
made by you in some bargain. 24, 68.</p>

<p><a id="HATRED"></a>HATRED. To dream that you hate any particular person is a sign
that he or she has been talking bad about you. If a girl should ever
be so silly as to dream such a dream about her lover, it shows that he
meditates an attack upon her chastity; on the contrary, if she dreams
that he hates her, it is a sign that she possesses his whole heart. 44.</p>

<p><a id="HAWK"></a>HAWK. If you dream of seeing a very large hawk, it shows that
you will soon begin a new enterprise; if the hawk darts down and
takes a chicken, a bird, or a fish, you will probably be successful; if
little birds attack the hawk and drive it away, you will have difficulties
in your undertaking and may possibly fail in it. 5, 55.</p>

<p><a id="HAY"></a>HAY. (<i>See <a href="#RAKING">Raking</a> and <a href="#HARVEST">Harvest</a>.</i>) To dream of making hay, signifies
success in all your undertakings. This is a good omen to young
lovers. To dream you are selling hay is a bad omen, and portends
losses in business and dangerous accidents. 49, 11.</p>

<p><a id="HEAD"></a>HEAD. To dream of heads in any way is a good omen: if you
dream your own head is very large, it shows that you will probably
become distinguished; if you see a large-headed person in your
dream, it is a sign you will make the acquaintance of some one who
will benefit you. 65, 9.</p>

<p><a id="HEAL"></a>HEAL. If you dream of having a sore on your person that was
healed up quick, it is a sign that some one will cut your acquaintance;
if you have a sweetheart or lover, it is probable something will happen
to break off the intimacy. 20.</p>

<p><a id="HEART"></a>HEART. To dream of a heart is a bad omen. If you lose your
heart it signifies sickness and death. To the married it denotes
infidelity of their marital vows. To dream you see a human heart
shows you are sincerely beloved; but to dream you have a pain or
palpitation in your heart shows you are doomed to suffer through
treachery. 46, 11.</p>

<p><a id="HEAT"></a>HEAT. If you dream of being in a place that is extremely hot, or
if the weather is so hot that the heat affects you, it shows that some person
is preparing either to attack you or give you a good scolding. 71, 6.</p>

<p><a id="HEN"></a>HEN. (<i>See <a href="#CHICKEN">Chicken</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="HIDE"></a>HIDE, or HIDDEN. To dream of concealing anything by hiding
it, or putting it in an out-of-the-way place, is a sign that some one
will reveal a secret that you have told. It is a bad omen for lovers
to dream of hiding things, as it predicts that their intimacy will be
talked about as suspicious. 45, 78.</p>

<p><a id="HILL"></a>HILL. To dream of going up a hill is a sign you will rise in the
world, and of going down hill the reverse; if, in your dream, you
seem to be approaching a smooth high hill, it shows that you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
shortly have a piece of good fortune; but if the hill be rugged and stony,
it foretells difficulties in connection with the good fortune. 1, 46, 18.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">To dream of mountains, hills, or rocks,</div>
  <div class="verse">Does signify, slouts, scoffs, and mocks;</div>
  <div class="verse">Their pains in passing over shew,</div>
  <div class="verse">That she whom you love, loves not you.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="HISSING"></a>HISSING. To dream of hearing hissing noises, such as steam
makes, or of geese hissing, is a sign of shame. If a girl dreams this,
it foretells that she will do something she is ashamed of: to a man
it is a sign he will do an undignified act, or one that will injure his
prospects. 47.</p>

<p><a id="HOG"></a>HOG. To dream of well-kept and happy-looking hogs is a good
omen, as it foretells luck and success: but if you see lean and hungry-looking
hogs squealing, it shows that any speculation you may
enter into about that time will not be of much account if it does not
result in a loss. 64.</p>

<p>HOG’S-BRISTLES. This dream denotes great violence and danger.
21, 7.</p>

<p><a id="HOLE"></a>HOLE. (<i>See <a href="#ABYSS">Abyss</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="HOMINY"></a>HOMINY. To dream of eating hominy with a relish is a sign that
you will marry below your station in life, or else you will entertain
a new acquaintance who is much below you in position, who will
eventually command your esteem. To an educated young girl such
a dream predicts a runaway match. 2, 10.</p>

<p><a id="HONEY"></a>HONEY. This dream denotes you will have a long and happy life.
If you dream you are eating honey it denotes that something will
happen that will give you great joy or pleasure. To a young girl it is
a sign that she will soon have a lover that will please her. 49, 3, 1.</p>

<p><a id="HOPS"></a>HOPS. To dream of seeing a large garden of hops in full leaf, denotes
thrift and wealth: if you see dried hops, and smell their fragrance,
it shows that you will shortly come into a good lump of money
from a legacy or a successful speculation. 27, 9.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">To maid who dreams of fragrant hops,</div>
  <div class="verse">A lover soon the question pops!</div>
  <div class="verse">And marries, too, with quick dispatch—</div>
  <div class="verse">Nine children fair will bless that match!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="HORNS"></a>HORNS. To see horns on the head of another person, danger to
the dreamer on your own wealth and importance. To dream you
are gored by a horned animal denotes unhappiness. To lovers it
usually predicts that they will have difficulty in connection with their
desires; if they think of marrying, some obstacle will be placed in the
way of their union, though perhaps not prevent it in the end. 9, 18,
36.</p>

<p><a id="HORSE"></a>HORSE. If you dream of riding well and easily on the back of this
noble animal, your fortune is sure to advance in the world: but if
you imagine you are thrown from a horse, it is a sign of disgrace.
To dream of swapping horses shows that some one will cheat you in
a bargain; of selling a horse, it is a sign of loss; but of buying one,
predicts that you will make money by some speculation, or else by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
selling property. Horses are excellent animals to dream about. 2,
11, 22.</p>

<p><a id="HOUSE"></a>HOUSE. (<i>See Repairing.</i>) To dream you build a house denotes you
will have a comfortable life: to burn your house signifies increased
riches: to dream you spill water in a house is a sign of care and
affliction: to dream you see a house fall denotes death. Dreaming
of building houses, wearing fine clothes, and talking with ladies, is a
sign that the parties will suddenly marry. 47, 66.</p>

<p><a id="HOUSEHOLD"></a>HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS. The pot denotes the life; the platter
the actions of life; the candlestick intends the wife; the light,
or lantern, the husband; the hearth the estate; vessels of wine are
the servants; the stores cupboards, and cabinets mean the wife.
24, 7.</p>

<p><a id="HUG"></a>HUG. If a young girl dreams of being fondled and hugged by her
lover, it is a sign he will soon get sick of her and want to be off: it
is not half so bad to let him hug her in real earnest as it is to dream
of it. The same sign holds good with the other sex. 2, 11.</p>

<p><a id="HUNGRY"></a>HUNGRY. (<i>See <a href="#FAST">Fast</a>.</i>) To dream of being hungry foretells that
you will soon engage in some new enterprise which will prove successful.
Hungry dreams are excellent omens to lovers, as they denote
energy and success. If a girl dreams that a gentleman comes
to see her who is hungry, it is a sign that he will woo her in such
an earnest and affectionate manner as to win her heart. 19, 37.</p>

<p><a id="HUSBANDRY"></a>HUSBANDRY. To dream of implements in husbandry, has a
variety of interpretations: to dream of a plough, denotes success in
life, and a good marriage; to dream of a yoke, is unfavorable, unless
it be broken; to dream of a team, death in a family, to dream of a
scythe signifies sickness. 76, 44.</p>

<p><a id="HUNTING"></a>HUNTING. To dream of going a hunting brings an accusation of
dishonesty: if you are returning from the chase, good fortune awaits
you. 8, 10.</p>

<p><a id="HUT"></a>HUT. To dream that you live in a small hut is a sign that you
will shortly have a house of your own. If in your dream, you visit
a little hut which is inhabited, it shows that you will be invited to
partake of the hospitalities of some family. 29, 70.</p>

<p><a id="ICE"></a>ICE. (<i>See <a href="#SKATING">Skating</a> and <a href="#SLIDING">Sliding</a>.</i>) To dream of walking on slippery
ice in winter, is a sign that misfortune threatens you: if you slip
down, it foreshadows bad luck: if you dream of gliding or skating
easily over smooth ice, it shows that you will probably have a difficulty
of some kind, but will overcome it and get through handsomely.
For lovers to dream of going over ice is a bad omen. 4, 28.</p>

<p><a id="ILLNESS"></a>ILLNESS. (<i>See <a href="#SICKNESS">Sickness</a>.</i>) To dream that you are ill and confined
to your bed is a sign that some one will overreach you in a bargain,
or cheat you in some way. Such a dream is a bad omen to loves,
as it predicts false vows. 16, 38.</p>

<p><a id="ILLUMINATION"></a>ILLUMINATION. To dream of an illumination augurs success in
life and much happiness; if the light begins to disappear, sorrow
and many tears will be your portion. 24, 68.</p>

<p><a id="IMPERTINENCE"></a>IMPERTINENCE. If a girl dreams that she meets a gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
who is impertinent toward her in conversation, it is a sign she will
make a new male acquaintance who will be very agreeable to her:
if she gets angry at the said impertinence she will probably fall in
love with her new friend and either marry him or be on improper
intimate terms with him. 1, 11.</p>

<p><a id="INDIGO"></a>INDIGO. To dream of indigo, denotes to a female that she will
cross the ocean. When she dreams of putting the indigo in water,
and it gives no color, she may be assured she will arrive in India.
But to embrace the water in the usual way, no such thing will come
to pass. 27, 15.</p>

<p><a id="INFANT"></a>INFANT. (<i>See <a href="#CHILD">Child</a>.</i>) Dreaming of a young infant is an excellent
omen, as it foretells joy and gladness, good luck, and success generally.
Lovers who dream such a dream may be sure of a happy and
thrifty marriage. To a business man this dream predicts a new and
successful enterprise. 29, 76.</p>

<p><a id="INK"></a>INK. To dream that you see splashes of ink on white paper, or on
anything, is a sign of scandal: after such a dream, you may be sure
that somebody will be talking pretty hard about you: the larger the
splashes the bigger will be the stories that are told. 41.</p>

<p><a id="INN"></a>INN. To dream of being at an inn, is very unfavorable; it denotes
poverty and unsuccessfulness in business; to the lover, the unfaithfulness
of his sweetheart; to the tradesman, loss of business and
dishonest agents. 46, 33.</p>

<p><a id="INQUEST"></a>INQUEST. To dream that you are present at a coroner’s inquest,
is a bad sign; you will soon squander your fortune. 49, 16.</p>

<p><a id="INSULT"></a>INSULT. (<i>See <a href="#ABUSE">Abuse</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="INUNDATION"></a>INUNDATION. (<i>See <a href="#OVERFLOW">Overflow</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="IRON"></a>IRON. (<i>See <a href="#METALS">Metals</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="ITCH"></a>ITCH. To dream that you have the itch, or that your body itches,
shows that you will shortly receive money. 40, 9.</p>

<p><a id="ISLAND"></a>ISLAND. To dream that you are on a deserted island shows that
you will commit some act to disgust your friends and make them cut
your acquaintance; be careful how you behave after dreaming such
a dream. 19, 65, 22.</p>

<p><a id="IVORY"></a>IVORY. To dream of ivory, signifies that you will be very successful
in business. To the single it is a sign they will soon fall in
love and be fortunate in their courtship. To the married it denotes
domestic happiness. 4, 75, 30.</p>

<p><a id="IVY"></a>IVY. To dream of seeing this vine running over and covering any
house, is a sign of poverty, particularly if the ivy grows thick and
abundant: if you dream that it covers your own house, the sign is
still more sure: for a farmer to dream that he sees ivy covering a
tree, denotes bad crops. A girl who dreams of being in a bower
covered with ivy, will probably marry a poor and shiftless man. 2.</p>

<p><a id="JAIL"></a>JAIL. (<i>See <a href="#PRISON">Prison</a>.</i>) If a man dreams he is confined in a prison or
jail, it shows that he will have honors or dignities conferred upon
him, as such dreams go contrariwise: if his arrest and imprisonment
worries him, it only shows that he will be the more delighted with
his new dignities. 46.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p><a id="JAR"></a>JAR. To dream that a house is jarred or shook by an earthquake,
an explosion, or anything that may occur outside, is a sign that the
head of the family in that house will be sick. Jars of preserved fruit
or jellies, seen in a dream, are good omens; if you dream you are
presented with one or more of them, it shows you will be long lived
and thrifty. 15, 39.</p>

<p><a id="JEALOUSY"></a>JEALOUSY. To dream you are jealous of your sweetheart, or
wife, signifies that they will betray you; for a maiden to dream she is
jealous of her sweetheart is a sign some particular friend will  “<i>cut
her out</i>;” for a wife to dream she is jealous of her husband, foretells
the loss of his love. 28, 6.</p>

<p><a id="JELLY"></a>JELLY. To dream of having pots of jelly given to you, or that you
are eating jelly, and that plenty of it is around, is a sure sign of long
life and good fortune generally; as many pots as are given to you, or
as you may have, so many generations will you live to see. The
same rule applies to preserved fruits. 65, 18, 78.</p>

<p><a id="JEW"></a>JEW. If you dream that a genuine Israelite comes along and
annoys you in any way, it is a sign you will quarrel with your father;
if you imagine that he cheats you in a bargain, it predicts that you
will probably receive a present from some near relative; on the contrary,
if he gives you an advantage in the bargain, it shows that
your father, or some elderly relative, will ask a favor of you. 58, 21.</p>

<p><a id="JEWELS"></a>JEWELS. Chains, pearls, or precious stones, etc., and all adornings
upon the heads and necks of women, are good dreams for the
fair sex; to widows and maids they signify marriage; and to those
that are married, riches. If a man dreams of possessing jewels, it is
a sure sign he will lose something of great value. 46, 75.</p>

<p><a id="JIG"></a>JIG. To dream of dancing a jig with a lady is a sign she is in love
with you, or is pleased with you; and if you like her you may go in
at once for her favor with much confidence. The omen is the same
to a girl who dreams of jigging with a young man. 1, 65, 14.</p>

<p><a id="JOLLY"></a>JOLLY. If you dream you are in company and feel particularly
hilarious, or jolly, it is a sign of sorrow; mark well who it is that contributes
most to your mirth, for he or she may cause you pain. If a
girl dreams this of a young man, let her beware of him for a gay
seducer. 20.</p>

<p><a id="JOY"></a>JOY. To dream that you are in the ecstasy of joy at anything that
has happened, bodes pain and trouble; something will be sure to
occur to make you unhappy. 46.</p>

<p><a id="JUMPING"></a>JUMPING. (<i>See <a href="#LEAPING">Leaping</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="JURY"></a>JURY. If a man dreams he is serving on a jury, it is a sign some
friend will ask a favor of him that he will hesitate to grant. 38, 3.</p>

<p><a id="KALEIDOSCOPE"></a>KALEIDOSCOPE. To dream you are looking through one of these
curious instruments, and if you are delighted with the changes that
present themselves, it is a sign, that you will either travel in distant
countries or be very discontented at home. 36, 75.</p>

<p><a id="KEG"></a>KEG. To dream of an empty one is a sign you will soon leave
home; a keg of small fish, or oysters, denotes the receipt of money;
a keg of spirits of any kind, promises poverty; a keg of powder foretells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
misfortune; a keg of paint predicts compliments to be paid you.
14.</p>

<p><a id="KEY"></a>KEY. If you dream of finding a key, or a bunch of keys, it is a sign
that some one will tell you a secret; to dream of losing a key, or keys,
is a bad omen, as it predicts that you will come to shame. Such a
dream is particularly unfortunate to a young lady. 41, 8.</p>

<p><a id="KID"></a>KID. To dream of a young and sportful kid, implies the birth of a
child. A young girl who grants her lover too close intimacy before
marriage should never dream of the innocent and harmless kid. It is
a good dream for married people who desire children. 70.</p>

<p><a id="KING"></a>KING. To dream of a king denotes that the dreamer is ambitious
and will be disappointed. If you dream you speak to a king it is a
happy omen, and is a sign of riches and honor. 4, 14.</p>

<p><a id="KILL"></a>KILL. If you dream of wantonly killing any animal, or insect, it
predicts bad luck and poverty; but if the killing be done by accident,
it shows that, though you may have a misfortune in consequence, it
will not materially affect your interest. For butchers or farmers to
dream of killing fat and healthy animals for food, is a sign of thrift
and abundance; but if they dream of killing a hog that does not squeal,
it shadows forth a death in the family. 41.</p>

<p><a id="KISSING"></a>KISSING. (<i>See <a href="#STRANGER">Stranger</a>.</i>) Dreams of kissing work curiously: if a
girl dreams that she is kissed by a young man in whom she takes
no particular interest, it may be a good omen, and it may not; for if
he happens to be a silly fellow who imagines that she is in love with
him, it is a sign she will be slandered in a way that will make her
unhappy; but if he has no such sentiment, then the sign is exactly
the reverse—that is, some one will speak well of her to those whom
she esteems highly—perhaps to her lover. If a girl dreams she is
kissed by her lover, it predicts that he will say something unpleasant
to her at their next meeting; if a lover dreams that his sweetheart
kisses him the sign is similar. 1.</p>

<p><a id="KITE"></a>KITE. To dream of flying a kite is a sign that you will soon write a
letter to some friend or acquaintance. For a girl to dream of seeing a
kite in the air, predicts that she will receive a letter from a young
man—whether a lover or not, is uncertain. 53, 62.</p>

<p><a id="KNEE"></a>KNEE. To dream of falling on the knees, denotes misfortune in
business. To see a woman’s knees, good luck and marriage to the girl
of your choice. For a woman to see a man’s knee, shows that she will
have many male children. 22, 37, 35.</p>

<p><a id="KNIVES"></a>KNIVES. To dream of knives is a bad omen; it betokens law-suits,
poverty, disgrace, and strife. In love, it shows quarrels and bad
tempers. 33, 9.</p>

<p><a id="LABOR"></a>LABOR. To dream you are hard at work, shows you will go a painful
journey, unless you be very circumspect; but to see others at work,
betokens good fortune. If a girl dreams she sees her lover at work, it
signifies that he will try and seduce her. 27, 9.</p>

<p><a id="LADDER"></a>LADDER. To dream of going up a ladder signifies that you will
be a person of some consequence, yet poor: if you imagine you are
in danger of falling, it shows that a person who envies your posi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>tion
will attempt to injure you; if you dream of going down a ladder
it particularly denotes poverty, though it may allude to some misfortune
that will overtake you. 14, 55.</p>

<p><a id="LADIES"></a>LADIES. To see one, a sign of weakness; many ladies bring
calumny and slander. To see a light-haired one, is a happy event to
the dreamer; a brunette, sickness; a pregnant lady, brings good news;
a naked lady, signifies the death of a relative. To hear a lady speak,
without seeing her, foretells departure. 47, 51, 11.</p>

<p><a id="LAKE"></a>LAKE. If you dream of sailing on a smooth and clear lake, it foreshadows
success in all your undertakings; if the lake is rough, but
yet has clear water, the sign still holds good, though you will encounter
difficulties; if it is muddy water, it denotes sickness, and losses
through dishonest people about you. 49, 17.</p>

<p><a id="LAMBS"></a>LAMBS. To see young lambs frisking around their mother, is an
excellent omen, as it denotes thrift, and also happiness in your family
ties; if you see them sucking, it is a sign of an increase in your family
by the birth of a child. For lovers to dream of young lambs, foretells
a speedy and happy marriage. 24, 60.</p>

<p><a id="LAMP"></a>LAMP. To dream of dropping or breaking a lighted lamp, denotes
disappointment. If, in your dream, you see the bright light of a
lamp at a distance from you in the dark, and you approach it, it
shows that you will either have good luck, or will be invited to visit
somewhere and meet an agreeable person of the opposite sex. 19.</p>

<p><a id="LAND"></a>LAND. To dream of buying or inheriting land, is an excellent
omen, as it foretells health and wealth; but to sell land in your dream,
denotes sickness and poverty. If a young man dreams of buying
land, it is a sign he will marry a rich wife. 34, 61, 18.</p>

<p><a id="LANTERN"></a>LANTERN. To dream of carrying a lantern in a dark night is a
good sign, provided you have no difficulty in finding your way, for it
shows that you will easily accomplish some fortunate object you may
have in view; if you stumble, or have difficulty in finding your way
with the lantern, it denotes trouble and vexation, though success will
be achieved at last. 28, 10.</p>

<p><a id="LARK"></a>LARK. To dream of the lark, shows speedy increase of fortune.
To lovers, this is a very favorable omen, and is a sign that the course
of true love runs smooth. 47, 68.</p>

<p><a id="LAUGHTER"></a>LAUGHTER. This omen is unfavorable, and is a sign of tears; it
also denotes that you will be worsted by your business engagements;
if a lover dreams he sees his sweetheart laugh, it is a sign she will
jilt him for a stranger; to the married it signifies domestic trouble. 40.</p>

<p><a id="LAUREL"></a>LAUREL or OLIVE. Denotes victory and pleasure; to the married,
inheritance and children; to the single, marriage. 71, 13, 1.</p>

<p><a id="LAW"></a>LAW. To dream of instituting a suit at law, or entering a criminal
complaint against any one, shows that some enemy will injure you
pecuniarily, or that you will lose money by speculation or trade; if
you dream you are sued, or prosecuted criminally, the sign is the reverse;
you will probably receive money unexpectedly, or be uncommonly
successful in your pursuits. 21, 8.</p>

<p><a id="LAWYER"></a>LAWYER. To dream of meeting a lawyer, brings bad tidings; if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
you speak to him, you will lose some property; if you hear some one
speaking in his favor, you will meet with some misfortune. 16.</p>

<p><a id="LAZY"></a>LAZY. To dream that you see lazy people lounging around, and
that you are vexed with them, is a sign of bad luck to some of your
relatives, who will depend upon you to assist them: if, in your dream,
you imagine yourself to be lazy and sleepy over your work, it foretells
either sickness or that you will meet with a loss. 62, 39, 69.</p>

<p><a id="LEAD"></a>LEAD. (<i>See <a href="#METALS">Metals</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="LEAPING"></a>LEAPING. To dream you are leaping over walls, doors or gates,

pursuits and that your sweetheart will not marry you. 9, 31.</p>

<p><a id="LEAVES"></a>LEAVES. To dream you see leaves growing freshly on a tree or
plant, is a good sign, and shows you will live long and be happy; but
to see leaves wither and fall to the ground, is a sign of sickness and
death. 47, 21.</p>

<p><a id="LEGS"></a>LEGS. To dream of thick and fat legs is a bad omen, as it foreshadows
sickness: thin, spindleshank legs are excellent ones to dream
about, as they denote a successful race with fortune. It is not to be
supposed that a lover will ever dream of his sweetheart’s legs, but if
he should do so, he will probably imagine them to be round, plump,
and of an alabaster whiteness; this is a bad dream, and he should by
all means avoid thinking of her legs when he goes to sleep: if a lady
dreams that her lover’s legs are thin, it foretells that he will be a
rich man. 48, 5.</p>

<p><a id="LEMONS"></a>LEMONS. To dream of lemons denotes contentions in your family
and uneasiness on account of children; they announce the death of
some relation and disappointment in love. 22.</p>

<p><a id="LEOPARD"></a>LEOPARD. To dream of this animal, signifies that you have
many false friends, who are endeavoring to ruin you, it also betokens
family quarrels and domestic unhappiness. 24, 76.</p>

<p><a id="LETTERS"></a>LETTERS. These paper missives are good to dream about: if you
dream you receive a great number of letters, it foretells that honors
await you: to receive one letter in your dream, denotes that some
one is praising you behind your back. If a girl dreams that she receives
a love-letter from her beau, it shows that he adores her: a
gentleman who has a similar dream of a letter from his sweetheart,
may rest satisfied that he only possesses her heart. 28, 54, 1.</p>

<p><a id="LETTER"></a>LETTER CARRIER. To dream of a letter carrier, indicates you
will hear from an absent one whom you love. 18, 50.</p>

<p><a id="LETTUCE"></a>LETTUCE. To dream of eating lettuce, is a sign of health and

<p><a id="LIAR"></a>LIAR. To dream that any one offends you by lying, or defaming
your family by lies, is a sign you will receive a benefit at the hands
of a stranger. 36.</p>

<p><a id="LIBERTY"></a>LIBERTY. To dream of taking liberties with any one, bids you be
careful of them; if others take liberties with you, it shows they intend
to cheat you. 39, 40.</p>

<p><a id="LICE"></a>LICE. To dream of lice denotes sickness and poverty. 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p><a id="LIE"></a>LIE. To dream of telling a lie about a woman, is a sign you will
kiss a black one: to dream that you lie about your business, denotes
that a colored man will rob you: lies generally, imagined in dreams,
denote either injuries or caresses by colored people. 14, 64.</p>

<p><a id="LIGHT"></a>LIGHT. (<i>See <a href="#CANDLES">Candles</a>, <a href="#LAMP">Lamp</a> and <a href="#TORCH">Torch</a>.</i>) To dream you see a great
light, is a happy presage; it denotes that you will attain honors, and
become rich; in love it shows a sweetheart of an amiable disposition.
8, 70, 2.</p>

<p><a id="LIGHTNING"></a>LIGHTNING. To dream of bright and vivid white lightning, denotes
that you will soon go on a pleasant trip or journey: blueish
silver forked lightning foretells good crops and excellent success in
business; red forked lightning the same, but attended with calamity,
or the death of relatives by violence. 24.</p>

<p><a id="LILIES"></a>LILIES. If you dream of an abundance of these beautiful flowers
in your garden or door-yard, it foretells good luck in getting servants
or people to work for you; it also denotes thrift generally about a
farm. If a young girl dreams about lilies, it is a sign she will marry
a smart and industrious man and live happily with him. 61.</p>

<p><a id="LIMEKILN"></a>LIMEKILN. To dream of burning lime in a kiln, or of seeing a kiln
in full blast, is a sign of health and abundant crops; but to see a
dilapidated and empty limekiln in your dream is the reverse of this,
as far as the crops are concerned. 77, 5, 15.</p>

<p><a id="LINEN"></a>LINEN. To dream you are arrayed in clean linen denotes that
you will shortly receive some glad tidings; and that your sweetheart
is faithful; if it is dirty, then it denotes poverty and disappointment
in love. White linen, if dressed in it, presages death; colored linen,
removal; shifts, a gay sweetheart; gowns, a gift. 24, 71.</p>

<p><a id="LION"></a>LION. If you dream of seeing the king of beasts, and if he is mild
and gentle looking, it shows that you will easily rise in the world to
a better position than you now occupy: to dream of an angry and
roaring lion, who tries to get at you, shows, that although you may
rise in position, jealous people will annoy and try to injure you. 14.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Dreams of lions, bears, bulls, bees,</div>
  <div class="verse">Nests of wasps or hornets, these</div>
  <div class="verse">Are emblems whereby are expressed</div>
  <div class="verse">Discord with those whom you love best.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="LIPS"></a>LIPS. (<i>See <a href="#MOUTH">Mouth</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="LIQUOR"></a>LIQUOR. If you dream of seeing large quantities of liquor, or of
buying brandy, rum, whisky, &amp;c., it foretells poverty and disgrace; to
dream of drinking it is the same, only worse if possible. 2.</p>

<p><a id="LIZARD"></a>LIZARD. To dream of lizards, is a sign you have secret enemies
who will injure you if they can. If a girl dreams this, it shows that
some one will question her virtue. 3.</p>

<p><a id="LOG"></a>LOG. To dream of seeing large logs around, is a sign that you will
soon move into a new house; but if you imagine that you are splitting
the logs, it will spoil all this, for it shows that you will want a house
badly without being able to get one to your mind. 21, 78.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>LOOKING-GLASS. To dream of a looking-glass, is a bad omen,
and signifies that you will be surrounded with false friends, who will
rob you until your property dwindles to a shadow. To dream you
see your face in a looking-glass is a sign of sickness. To break a
looking-glass portends death. If a girl dreams she sees her lover in
a looking-glass, it is a sign he will desert or seduce her. 18, 61.</p>

<p><a id="LOSSES"></a>LOSSES. To dream of losing your hat is a sign you will entertain
a large company, either by making a speech, or otherwise attracting
their attention: dreaming of the loss of money, a watch, or any valuables
of that kind, predicts that you will gain as much and perhaps
more than your loss amounts to: if a girl dreams of losing her shoe-strings,
she will be kissed by an agreeable young man; any article
of clothing that you may dream of having lost, shows that you will
rig yourself out in a new suit. 47, 6.</p>

<p><a id="LOTTERY"></a>LOTTERY. (<i>See <a href="#PRIZE">Prize</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="LOVE"></a>LOVE. To dream you are in love is a sign you will make a fool of
yourself and do something silly, of which you may afterwards be
ashamed—thus showing that the dream works contrariwise—for love
is anything but a silly sentiment unless indulged in by fools. For a
young girl to dream of falling in love foretells that she will be laughed
at and ridiculed for some folly. 64, 52, 1.</p>

<p><a id="LUCK"></a>LUCK. To imagine in your dream that you have had excellent
luck, in any enterprise, predicts a misfortune: if a man has had a
quarrel with his sweetheart, and dreams that it is all made up, he
may be sure that the quarrel will continue a great deal longer than
is agreeable to him: to a young lady, the sign is the same relative to
her beau. 18.</p>

<p><a id="MAD_DOG"></a>MAD DOG. To dream of seeing such an animal frothing at the
mouth and running, is a sign you will be wrongfully accused of a
dishonorable action or crime. 4, 12, 61.</p>

<p><a id="MAGGOTS"></a>MAGGOTS. To dream of seeing any thing putrid and covered with
maggots, is a sign of death; but the death may be that of your favorite
dog, cat, or bird, though such a dream often foretells the death
of a relative or friend. 5.</p>

<p><a id="MAID"></a>MAID. (<i>See <a href="#VIRGIN">Virgin</a>.</i>) If you dream you are pleased with a pretty
chambermaid, milkmaid, or any nice-looking young girl, whose occupation
carries with it the title of maid, it is a good omen, for it
predicts an excellent match, and plenty of children: it also foretells,
in many cases, that the dreamer will marry a rich wife. 75, 39.</p>

<p><a id="MAN"></a>MAN. To dream of a man dressed in black is lucky; in white, a
bad omen: to dream of a murdered man, is a sign of long life. To
dream you meet a strange man, is a sign you have a vindictive enemy.
For a girl to dream she sees her lover by her bedside, is a sign
he will attempt some very improper things. 74, 60, 7.</p>

<p><a id="MANNERS"></a>MANNERS. To dream of ill-mannered people, who annoy you by

go on a journey, and be introduced to a fool. 6, 65.</p>

girl dreams this when her lover is away, he will return unexpectedly.
24, 17.</p>

<p><a id="MARKET"></a>MARKET. To dream you are in a large market, where all kinds of
meats and vegetables are sold, is a sign you will want money that it
will be difficult and perhaps impossible to raise; it is a bad sign for
tradesmen and others who have notes to pay. 31, 9.</p>

<p><a id="MARRIAGE"></a>MARRIAGE. (<i>See <a href="#WEDDING">Wedding</a>.</i>) If any one should be so unfortunate
as to dream that he or she was present at a happy and jolly wedding,
it denotes that they will attend a funeral; it will not necessarily
be at the burial of either of the persons you dreamed you saw
married, but you will undoubtedly be called to mourn some friend or
relative. To dream of being married yourself, foretells your death.
2, 78, 42.</p>

<p><a id="MASK"></a>MASK. To dream you see a person wearing a mask, is a sign of
hypocrisy; to the lover, it shows that his sweetheart loves some one
better than himself; to a girl, it signifies that her lover is engaged to
another. To married people, it portends infidelity to the wedding-ring.
46, 8.</p>

<p><a id="MASS"></a>MASS. To dream of going to this religious celebration, is a sign
that some one will either cheat you or rob your house. If a girl
dreams this, let her look out that her lover does not prove to be a
worthless scamp. 13.</p>

<p><a id="MEADOW"></a>MEADOW. (<i>See <a href="#FIELDS">Field</a> and <a href="#GREEN">Green</a>.</i>) If you dream of walking in a
green and pleasant meadow, where the grass grows regular and looks
smooth, it is an excellent omen, for it denotes thrift and good luck
generally. Such a dream to a farmer, is a sign of good crops and
plenty of money. To lovers, it foretells a happy and speedy marriage.
72, 6.</p>

<p><a id="MEANNESS"></a>MEANNESS. To dream you are treated in a mean and shabby
manner by anybody, is a sign you will have unexpected honors thrust
upon you. If a girl dreams that her lover has behaved meanly, she
may be sure he will do something to command her admiration. 9,
50, 51.</p>

<p><a id="MEASLES"></a>MEASLES. To dream you have this troublesome disorder shows
that you will be fortunate, provided you engage in some disreputable
or dishonest speculation, or in a robbery of money: but to conscientious
people the omen does not hold good. If a girl dreams of having
the measles, it predicts that a rogue will make love to her. 33, 4.</p>

<p><a id="MEAT"></a>MEAT. To dream of sweet and wholesome fresh meat is a sign
you will be coquetted by a lady, and perhaps fall in love with her;
but if the meat is putrid or maggoty, it foreshadows sickness and
death. 8, 16.</p>

<p><a id="MEDICINE"></a>MEDICINE. (<i>See <a href="#PHYSIC">Physic</a>.</i>) To take medicine foretells poverty, to
give any one medicine, gain. 22, 37, 8.</p>

<p><a id="MELONS"></a>MELONS. To dream of ripe, fine looking melons, is an excellent
omen, as it foretells good health, good luck, and much happiness. A
watermelon full of black seeds denotes so much money to be paid to
you. If a married woman dreams this, it promises her many children.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p><a id="METALS"></a>METALS. To dream of metals has different signification and interpretations
according to the metal you dream of. To enable our
readers to more readily discover the meaning of their dreams, we subjoin
a list of the metals with their explanations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brass.</span> To dream that you see a brass ornament, is a sign your
sweetheart will be false to you. To see any one working in brass,
or cleaning that metal is a sign you will hear of the death of a distant
relative who will leave you a legacy. 43, 11.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Copper.</span> To dream of copper, signifies that your sweetheart is
deceitful and loves another, it also shows secret enemies. 54, 8, 40.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold.</span> To dream of receiving gold is a good sign, and shows you
will be successful in all your undertakings. To dream you pay gold
betokens increase of friends. 49, 7.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iron.</span> For one to dream that he is hurt with iron, signifies that
he shall receive some damage. 44, 5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lead.</span> To dream of lead denotes sickness, but to dream of leaden
bullets good news. If you dream you are wounded by a leaden bullet
it is a sign you will be successful in love. 49, 50.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quicksilver.</span> To dream of this metal is a sign your friends
will all be false to you, it is also a sign of losses in property. 49, 19.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silver.</span> To dream that you are presented with spoons, or any
silver plate for household use, foretells that you or some near relative,
will shortly marry: if you dream of buying these articles, it is a
sign of poverty: to dream of silver dollars, or bars of silver, used in
commerce, is a sign that you will gain money either by a legacy or
speculation. 49, 6.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steel.</span> To break a piece in a dream, shows that you will overcome
your enemies; if you only touch it, your position in life is
secure; if you try to bend it, and cannot, you will meet with many
serious accidents. 41, 50.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tin.</span> To dream of tin is a good omen and signifies you will marry
a rich wife, and make money at business. 41, 8.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zink.</span> To dream of this metal denotes happiness and prosperity to
the dreamer. To lovers it is a sign of success in love affairs. 48.</p>

<p><a id="MIDWIFE"></a>MIDWIFE. To see a midwife denotes revealing of secrets; to the
sick, it is death. 18, 4.</p>

<p><a id="MILK"></a>MILK. (<i>See <a href="#PITCHER">Pitcher</a> and <a href="#BREAST">Breast</a>.</i>) Dreaming of milk predicts, to a
man, the love of a lady. If a newly married lady dream that she has
a full breast of milk, it is a sign that she will be happily delivered of
a fine child; to an old woman, it portends much money. 45, 60.</p>

<p><a id="MILL"></a>MILL. If you dream of going to a flouring-mill, where you see
plenty of grain and flour, it is a good omen, as it shadows forth thrift
and abundance; but to imagine in your dream that you are in any
manufactory of cloth fabrics called a mill, is a sign of poverty and
want. Girls who work in such places should be careful never to
dream of them. 55.</p>

<p><a id="MISER"></a>MISER. To dream of a miser is a sign of waste, loss or destruction:
if you see him counting and hoarding money, it foretells you
will either lose or be robbed of some: to see him patching his clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
or his house or barn denotes a calamity, such as a robbery or a fire.
14, 62.</p>

<p><a id="MISFORTUNE"></a>MISFORTUNE. To dream you have a misfortune denotes luck
and success: thus; dreaming of the loss of money is a sign you will
get some: if you imagine your house is burned, you will be successful
in a speculation: if you dream of being robbed, it foretells a
legacy or the finding of something valuable, &amp;c. 41.</p>

<p><a id="MISTAKE"></a>MISTAKE. If any one dreams of being vexed, annoyed, or injured
by reason of making a mistake, it shadows forth disgrace. Mistaking
one person for another in your dream, denotes scandal: thus if a
young girl should dream that she hailed a young man as her lover,
and found it was a stranger, it shows that some malicious person
will talk lightly of her character. 78, 16.</p>

<p><a id="MONEY"></a>MONEY. (<i>See Purse and Pocket Book.</i>) To dream of finding money
is an excellent omen, as it foretells that you will soon get some: if,
in your dream, you see bank bills of a large denomination, or large
gold pieces, the sign is similar: to see small pieces of money is not
so good, though it is a pretty fair dream. To dream of receiving
money is a good omen; in love, it foretells marriage and children.
To dream you lose money, is a proof you will be unsuccessful in
some favorite pursuit. 18, 4.</p>

<p><a id="MONKEY"></a>MONKEY. To dream that you see a monkey, and are pleased with
his antics, shows that you will make the acquaintance of a fool. For
a girl to dream of playing with a monkey is a sign she will do something
she is ashamed of, and perhaps lose her virtue. Monkeys are
also a sign of law suits and secret enemies. 17, 6.</p>

<p><a id="MOON"></a>MOON. To dream of a sharp new moon with horns pointing upwards
is a sign you will be rich: if the horns point sideways or
downward, it foretells poverty: seeing a full moon in your dream
denotes a thrifty and happy marriage: a half moon shadows forth
the loss of a wife or husband by death or desertion. Dreaming of
seeing a half moon is fatal to the prospects of lovers. 19, 18.</p>

<p><a id="MOUNTAIN"></a>MOUNTAIN. To dream of approaching beautiful smooth-looking
mountains, dressed in verdure, denotes thrift and happiness, and that
you will rise in the world: if the mountains look steep, rugged and
rocky, it foreshadows difficulties and danger, which you may overcome
by energy: to dream of successfully climbing a mountain, is a
sure sign that some honor awaits you, or that you will make a good
deal of money: difficulties in climbing show troubles and vexations
in getting your honors or your money. 64.</p>

<p><a id="MOTH"></a>MOTH. To dream of moth is a sign some one is robbing you, it
also predicts slander by a supposed friend. To dream you see a
moth burn its wings in a flame signifies that an enemy will die. 22.</p>

<p><a id="MOTHER"></a>MOTHER. If you dream of quarreling with your mother, it is a
sign she will do some generous act, or confer a benefit that will delight
you: to dream of fondling your mother shadows forth her loss
by death, or that you will be parted from her: if you dream she
makes you a present, the dream will come true so far that she will
probably present you with a new brother or sister. 46, 34.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p><a id="MOURNING"></a>MOURNING. To dream that you are dressed in mourning for the
death of a relative, is a sign that a wedding will soon take place in

to be present at a marriage ceremony. 32, 12.</p>

<p><a id="MOUSE"></a>MOUSE. (<i>See <a href="#TRAP">Trap</a>.</i>) To dream of killing a mouse is a sign you
will detect a thief in stealing from you: if, in your dream, you see a
mouse, or a number of mice, it foretells that you will soon have
thieves in the house. For a girl to dream that she pets a mouse,
shows that she will have a light-fingered or dishonest lover. 75, 70.</p>

<p><a id="MOUTH"></a>MOUTH. Dreaming of a large mouth and big lips is a sure sign
you will be kissed by some one of the opposite sex: to dream of a
mouth out of shape, or with a hare lip, denotes to a woman that she
will have a deformed child, and to a man that he will get into a difficulty
by means of his intimacy with a woman: to dream of a small
mouth and thin lips is a sign of loud and angry words, and that some
one will give you a scolding. 27, 6, 3.</p>

<p><a id="MOVING"></a>MOVING. To dream of moving your residence or place of business,
under any circumstances, is a sign of poverty: if, in your dream,
you see other people moving, it foretells that some one of your relatives
will come to poverty, and you will have to assist him. 55.</p>

over you, is a sign that you will be belied and talked about. 29.</p>

happy marriage; to the married, affection and constancy. 64, 70, 3.</p>

<p><a id="MULATTO"></a>MULATTO. (<i>See <a href="#NEGRO">Negro</a>.</i>) To see a mulatto in sleep, brings good
luck; a female mulatto, dangerous sickness. 4, 11, 44.</p>

<p><a id="MULE"></a>MULE. To dream of riding a mule, or driving one, is a sign of
celibacy: gentlemen or ladies who dream this may safely calculate
that they will live single for the rest of their lives, unless some more
vivid dream with a favorable omen should counterbalance the influence
of this one. If married people dream of mules, it foretells that
they will be childless. 4, 51, 66.</p>

<p><a id="MUSHROOM"></a>MUSHROOM. To dream you eat mushrooms is a sign you will live
to a good old age, but to dream you see them grow, or gather them,
is a sign you will get rich by a splendid speculation, and then get
poor as suddenly as you got wealthy. 49, 59.</p>

<p><a id="MUSIC"></a>MUSIC. (<i>See <a href="#SINGING">Singing</a>.</i>) To dream of hearing strains of sweet music,
denotes joy and happiness. If a girl who has a lover dreams this, he
will surprise her either with a splendid present, or with an invitation
to go somewhere where she will be delighted and enjoy herself much.
74, 18.</p>

<p><a id="MUSTARD"></a>MUSTARD. To dream of mustard or mustard seed, is a bad omen,
and foretells sickness and perhaps death. To dream you eat mustard,
is a sign your sweetheart or lover is false to you. To married persons
this dream indicates domestic quarrels. 4.</p>

quarrels and dissensions: to dream of paring your nails, foretells a
lingering sickness. 57, 8.</p>

<p><a id="NAKEDNESS"></a>NAKEDNESS. To dream you see a man naked, signifies fear and
terror: to dream you see a woman naked, signifies honor and joy,
provided she be fair-skinned and handsome; but if she is crooked,
old, wrinkled, or otherwise ill made, and black withal, it signifies
shame, repentance, and ill luck. For a woman to dream she sees her
husband naked, signifies success in her enterprises and a good number
of children. 14.</p>

<p><a id="NAPKIN"></a>NAPKIN. A white napkin denotes orderly conduct, which will
bring happiness; a dirty napkin, disorderly behavior. 70, 6.</p>

<p><a id="NAVEL"></a>NAVEL. If you dream that your navel is out of shape, or looks
queer, it is a sign of misfortune in connection with the opposite sex,
unless you are married, in which case it denotes the birth of a child:

35, 17.</p>

<p><a id="NECK"></a>NECK. If a woman or girl dreams that her neck is large and thick,
it is a sure sign she will bear many children: if it seems smaller than
usual, it denotes to a married woman a miscarriage, and to a girl the
loss of her beau: if a woman dreams that her neck is fair and beautiful,
it foretells that some gentleman will make love to her. 22.</p>

<p><a id="NECKLACE"></a>NECKLACE. For a girl to dream that a gentleman presents her
with a necklace, is a sign that some one meditates an attempt to seduce
her: if a married woman dreams that her husband gives her a
necklace, it shows that she will soon be in the family way. 69, 12, 21.</p>

<p><a id="NEEDLES"></a>NEEDLES. To dream of needles, signifies that you will be grievously

a good sign, as it denotes safety: if the negro comes towards you in
a pleasant and agreeable way, it shows that you will meet with a loss
or be robbed: to see a grinning, pleasant-looking negro in your dream,
forebodes trouble through the conduct of a dependent. 32.</p>

<p><a id="NEW"></a>NEW YEAR’S PRESENT. To dream you give a New Year’s
present, signifies you will hear good news. To receive one, is a sign
you will soon get into trouble. 64, 19.</p>

<p><a id="NIAGARA"></a>NIAGARA. As every one has heard of this great cataract, and
multitudes have seen it, it is not strange that a good many people
dream of going there: such a dream is a sign that you will be embarrassed
in company by a sensation of some kind. 13, 49, 6.</p>

<p><a id="NIGHT"></a>NIGHT. (<i>See <a href="#STARS">Stars</a>.</i>) To dream of a clear beautiful night when the
stars are shining, indicates that you will have a long and happy life
and be very successful in all your undertakings. To dream you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
courting your sweetheart on such a night shows that she is true to
you. To dream of a cloudy night portends disasters in business, and
to dream of a stormy night indicates sickness. 5, 19.</p>

<p><a id="NIGHTCAP"></a>NIGHTCAP. For a girl to dream that she forgot to take off her
nightcap, but received company in it, is a sign she will be kissed by
a strange gentleman, or that some stranger will be smitten by her
charms: if a married woman dreams this, it foretells that her husband
will be jealous of her, and perhaps not without cause. 70.</p>

<p><a id="NIGHTINGALE"></a>NIGHTINGALE. To dream of this bird signifies light amours; to
hear it sing, happiness. 48.</p>

<p><a id="NOBILITY"></a>NOBILITY. Should anybody be so foolish as to dream that they
are created a Duke, an Earl, or that they have conferred upon them
any patent of nobility, it is a sign of shiftlessness and poverty. If a
girl dreams that a lord is in love with her, she will be apt to marry
a shiftless and needy fellow. 21, 19.</p>

<p><a id="NOISE"></a>NOISE. If you dream of hearing strange or mysterious noises, it
is a sign that the spirit of some dead relative hovers near you, and
has an influence upon your actions. 20.</p>

<p><a id="NOSE"></a>NOSE. To dream of big-nosed people is generally a good omen, as
such persons are usually smart and energetic. To dream of snub
noses is a sign of a quarrel, or that you will be abused by somebody.
48.</p>

<p><a id="NUGGET"></a>NUGGET. This is an English word for a lump of gold: to dream
of digging a big nugget of pure gold, is a sign of wealth and honors.
Dreams relative to gold or silver promise good fortune always. 4,
11, 44.</p>

<p><a id="NUN"></a>NUN. For a young girl to dream of seeing a sober-looking nun, is
a sign of celibacy; if she imagines she speaks to the nun she may
safely calculate on being an old maid; if a young man dreams this,
it foretells that he will suspect his sweetheart of being untrue to him,
and probably discard her altogether. 29, 65.</p>

<p><a id="NURSE"></a>NURSE. Dreaming of a nurse for lying-in women foreshadows
luck and plenty of cash; to a farmer, such a dream prognosticates
abundant crops, and to newly married people good crops of children.
28.</p>

<p><a id="NUTS"></a>NUTS. To dream of nuts denotes riches and happiness; to the
lover, success; if you are gathering them, it is a good omen; but if
you crack them, unfavorable. 48, 6.</p>

<p><a id="OAK"></a>OAK. To dream of seeing a very large oak tree, and of gathering
acorns under it, is a sign that some wealthy relative will leave you a
fortune by will: if anybody dreams this who does not happen to have
wealthy relations, it may turn out that somebody else will take the
liberty of making a will in his or her favor; if not, a streak of good
luck will come in some other way to make the matter right. 65.</p>

<p><a id="OAR"></a>OAR. If you dream of sailing in a boat, and losing one or more of
the oars, it is a sign of the death of your father, mother, or guardian,
or of some one to whom you look for protection: if an engaged young
girl or a married woman dreams this, it foretells the death of a lover
or husband. 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p><a id="OATH"></a>OATH. To dream of taking a solemn oath before a magistrate, or
in a court of justice, foretells quarreling and litigation: even if you
are a timid and quiet person, such a dream promises that some one
will quarrel with you. 20.</p>

<p><a id="OATS"></a>OATS. To dream of this grain foretells a journey by land: if an
engaged young girl dreams of oats, it denotes that her wedding tour
is not far off. 69.</p>

<p><a id="OCEAN"></a>OCEAN. (<i>See <a href="#SEA">Sea</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="ODD"></a>ODD FELLOW. To dream of joining a society of this order foretells
sickness and distress: if you are already an Odd Fellow, and
dream of strife in the Lodge, and that you are in danger of being
turned out, it is a sign that you will attain a higher station in life by
riches or honors. 2.</p>

<p><a id="OFFICER"></a>OFFICER. (<i>See <a href="#POLICE">Police</a>.</i>) To dream that a military officer is in your
company shadows forth beggary and disgrace. If a girl dreams that
she has such a person for a lover, she may calculate that her first
suitor will be a poor shoat, of no account whatever. 70, 28.</p>

<p><a id="OIL"></a>OIL. To dream it is spilled on the floor, signifies damage; to spill
it on yourself, profit. 1, 41.</p>

<p><a id="OLD_MAN"></a>OLD MAN. To dream of seeing a man bowed down with age is a
sign of good luck in business, and to a politician it denotes advancement.
This is not a good dream for females, for to them it denotes
want. 63.</p>

<p><a id="OLD_WOMAN"></a>OLD WOMAN. To dream of an aged woman is generally a good
omen, as it shadows forth domestic happiness: to a married woman
such a dream foretells the birth of a child: to a young girl, that she
will have an offer of marriage. 3.</p>

<p><a id="ONIONS"></a>ONIONS. To dream of this vegetable, denotes both good and bad
luck: if you are eating them, you will soon receive some money;
your sweetheart will be faithful, but cross, and you will be engaged
in some dispute; if you are throwing onions away, it is the forerunner
of mischief; in love, quarrels; in trade, opposition. 5, 8, 48.</p>

<p><a id="OPERA"></a>OPERA. To dream of going to the opera is a sign you will travel:
if you hear a new singer that delights you, it foretells that you will
make a new acquaintance on some journey: if an engaged young
lady dreams of the opera, her wedding journey is thus shadowed
forth. 27, 55.</p>

<p><a id="OPIUM"></a>OPIUM. To dream of this drug foretells sickness and poverty: if
you imagine that you see some one under the influence of opium, and
in danger of dying, it foretells a misfortune either to yourself or some
near relative. 64.</p>

<p><a id="ORANGE"></a>ORANGE. To dream of having an abundance of oranges, shadows
forth that you will get just so much yellow gold: if you dream of
eating them, it promises you health: if you give them to friends, it
foretells that you will be honored and esteemed: if a girl dreams
that her lover presents her with fine-looking oranges, he will undoubtedly
bring her a fortune when she marries. 3, 12, 36.</p>

<p><a id="ORCHARD"></a>ORCHARD. If, in your dream, you imagine you are in a fine orchard,
and the fruit looks fair and tempting, and you eat of it, it fore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>tells
that you will shortly be engaged in some pleasant adventure
either of love or intrigue: if you see rotten, wormy, or scraggy-looking
apples, it shows that you will be thrown into mean and low company,
much to your disgrace. Such dreams are bad ones for young
girls. 18, 12.</p>

<p><a id="ORGAN"></a>ORGAN. To dream of hearing the solemn and enchanting music
of a church organ is a sad omen to young girls, as it foretells their
early death: if a gentleman dreams this, it points to the death of
some young girl in whom he takes an interest, and perhaps to his
sweetheart, if he has one. To imagine you hear some lively tune on
a street organ is also a bad omen, as it foretells that you will soon
attend a funeral. 55, 3.</p>

<p><a id="OVEN"></a>OVEN. (<i>See <a href="#BAKING">Baking</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="OVERFLOW"></a>OVERFLOW. (<i>See <a href="#FLOOD">Flood</a>.</i>) To dream that a river, or any stream,
overflows its banks and surrounds your house with water, is a sign
of wealth; that is, you will acquire riches in proportion to the quantity
of water around, and the ground it covers: if you fancy that any
one is drowned in the water, it foretells a misfortune in connection
with your riches. 9, 66, 18.</p>

<p><a id="OWL"></a>OWL. To dream of seeing one of these birds of night in a roosting
position, is a sign that you will discover an important secret that relates
to yourself: to see an owl flying foretells that some secret of
your own will get out. 3.</p>

<p><a id="OXEN"></a>OXEN. (<i>See <a href="#CATTLE">Cattle</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="OYSTERS"></a>OYSTERS. If, in your dream, you imagine you are eating oysters,
it denotes that you will have difficulties relative to money matters:
but to rake them out of the water is a sign of money-getting: to
dream of opening nice fat oysters for other people to eat is also a
favorable omen, as it shows that you will have plenty of cash. 7, 53.</p>

<p><a id="PAINTING"></a>PAINTING. To dream of painting your house is a sign of sickness
in the family, but at the same time thrift and good luck in business:
if, in your dream, you see a white house newly painted outside, you
will probably soon be summoned to attend a funeral: to see any
other colored house newly painted, foretells that you will hear of the
sickness of a friend or relative: dreaming of beautiful paintings of
landscapes, portraits, &amp;c., is an omen of bad luck and poverty. 22,
11, 5.</p>

<p>PALL-BEARER. For a man to dream that he is a pall-bearer at a
funeral, denotes that he will be married within a year: to dream of
seeing pall-bearers, is a sign you will be invited to a wedding. 49, 6.</p>

<p><a id="PANCAKE"></a>PANCAKE. (<i>See Thick.</i>) For a girl to dream of baking pancakes,
is a sign that some gentleman is in love with her; and if a married
woman has such a dream, she may be sure that some man, other
than her husband, admires her; to dream of eating pancakes, foretells
falling in love, to either sex; and if you relish them, you will be successful
in your love. 36.</p>

<p><a id="PANTALOONS"></a>PANTALOONS. If you dream you have a new pair of pantaloons,
it is a sign you will be prosperous; if they do not fit, and are too
tight, it is a sign you will be pinched in money matters; if they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
dark, it is a sign of long life, but if light, it denotes sickness. Young
girls should try and not dream about pantaloons, for such an omen
is very dangerous to them. 46, 8.</p>

<p><a id="PANTHER"></a>PANTHER. To dream that you see one of these animals, and are
terrified by it, shows that you will be disgusted at the ingratitude of
a friend you have served: if, in your dream, you see a tame panther,
and caress it, it foretells that you have some ungrateful person in
your household, (perhaps a servant,) or else a false-hearted friend. 41.</p>

<p><a id="PAPER"></a>PAPER. To dream of smooth paper, is a good omen; but if it appears
rumpled, it will give you much pain. To dream of paper that
is wet, signifies success in love matters. 21, 18.</p>

<p><a id="PARADE"></a>PARADE. To dream of a parade of soldiers, and that you are delighted
with the military display, foretells that some one will deceive
you: to a business man it is an omen of losses by bad debts or dull
trade: to a young girl it foreshadows a gay but false lover: to a
married woman it is a sign that her husband, though kind, will be
false to his vows. 58, 1.</p>

<p><a id="PARASOL"></a>PARASOL. If a young woman dreams she has got a new parasol,
it predicts for her a new lover: if she imagines she has broken her
parasol, her lover (if she has one) will leave her; if not, then some
male friend, in whom she placed confidence or derived advantage,
will fail her: to a married woman, dreaming of a broken parasol is a
very bad omen, as it predicts ruin to her husband. 34.</p>

<p><a id="PARDON"></a>PARDON. To dream of asking pardon for an offence, is a bad
omen under any circumstances, as it foretells humiliation and disgrace:
for a criminal to imagine, in his dream, that the Governor has
pardoned him, is a sign that he will not only not be pardoned, but
that he will suffer much remorse and unhappiness in his imprisonment.
19, 3, 40.</p>

<p><a id="PARROT"></a>PARROT. To dream that you are pleased with the chattering of
one of these birds, is a sign that some deceitful person will flatter
you: if an engaged young girl has such a dream, she should look
sharp to the antecedents of her lover before marriage, as it is ten to
one that he is not worthy of her confidence: the dream may, however,
point to some other flatterer. 15, 2, 33.</p>

<p><a id="PARTING"></a>PARTING. To dream of parting from friends with regret, is a sign
of disappointment: if a girl dreams that her lover is going away anywhere,
and she feels bad when he takes his leave, it predicts that he
will not  “go raving distracted with delight” the next time he comes
to see her, and she will consequently be disappointed at his supposed
coolness; but all this may not amount to anything more than to make
her feel bad for the time being. 4.</p>

<p><a id="PARTNER"></a>PARTNER. (<i>See <a href="#BALL">Ball</a>.</i>) To dream that your partner in a dance
slights or snubs you, is a sign that some one is enamored of you:
this applies to either sex: if you dream of a particularly agreeable
and attractive partner, it shows that you will quarrel with somebody
of the opposite sex: for a man in business to dream of taking a partner,
foretells that he will be robbed. 17, 38.</p>

<p><a id="PARTY"></a>PARTY. To dream of giving a large and sumptuous party to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
friends, is a sign of losses and poverty: if you imagine you go to
such a party, it foretells that you will be asked to assist some one in
distress. 77, 18, 42.</p>

<p><a id="PASTURE"></a>PASTURE. (<i>See <a href="#CATTLE">Cattle</a>.</i>) To dream of seeing cattle feeding in a
green and rich pasture, foretells thrift and wealth: if the grass is
sun-burnt and only green in patches, and the cattle look lean, the
sign is the reverse; and such a dream denotes short crops to farmers.
6, 11, 66.</p>

<p><a id="PATCHES"></a>PATCHES. For a woman to dream of patching the clothes of her
husband or children, is an excellent omen, as it denotes that each
patch will be a good lump of money brought into the family. 5.</p>

<p><a id="PATENT"></a>PATENT RIGHT. To dream of procuring a patent for an invention
of your own, shows that you will never realize anything from it:
if money is to be made by it, some one else will get the benefit: if
you dream of getting a patent for some other person, it is a sign of
good luck in a speculation. 33, 17.</p>

<p><a id="PATHS"></a>PATHS. To dream you are walking in a broad, good pathway,
denotes health and success; in love it shows you will meet with a
sweetheart, who will make you happy, but if the path is crooked
it foretells trouble to the dreamer. 44.</p>

<p><a id="PAUPER"></a>PAUPER. To dream that you visit the poor-house and see the inmates,
is a sign to a woman that she will bear many children, and to
a man that he will raise a large family, such a dream to a young girl
foretells that she will be apt to become a mother before she is a wife. 21.</p>

<p><a id="PAWNBROKER"></a>PAWNBROKER. If you dream of pawning any of your goods at
a pawnbroker’s, provided you have never patronized such a place,
it foretells that fortune is about to smile on you, and if you take advantage
of the circumstance, you will surely get rich. To lazy and
shiftless people, such a dream would not be of much account. 4,
11, 22.</p>

<p><a id="PEACHES"></a>PEACHES. To dream of fine, ripe, yellow peaches, denotes that
you will get just so much yellow gold, which makes this dream a
splendid one for gold-diggers: if the peaches you dream about are
very red, or look small and wilted, it shows that your gold will turn
out to be about half copper, or that your luck will not amount to
much. 17, 1, 9.</p>

<p><a id="PEACOCK"></a>PEACOCK. To dream of this proud bird, is a sign of poverty; if
you imagine that he spreads his tail, and exhibits all his finery, so
much the worse. For a girl to dream of a peacock, shows that she
will have an empty-headed fop for a lover, who will turn out to be as
poor as a rat. 65, 54.</p>

<p><a id="PEANUTS"></a>PEANUTS. To dream of an abundance of ground-nuts, or peanuts,
shows that you will be poor, but contented, healthy and happy.
If a married woman in the family-way dreams of them, it is a sign
she will have a boy. 11.</p>

<p><a id="PEAS"></a>PEAS. To dream of eating green peas, is a sign of health; and if
you imagine that you eat crooked dry peas, it foretells both health
and thrift. If you dream of feeding any animal with dry peas, it
foreshadows good luck. 6.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p><a id="PEARLS"></a>PEARLS. To dream of these gems, denotes poverty and misery;
if a girl dreams that a lover gives her a piece of jewelry set in pearls,
it shows that he will never be well off; and if she imagines that he
presents her with a string or necklace of pearls, she may safely calculate
that he will turn out to be a wretchedly poor man. 56.</p>

<p><a id="PEARS"></a>PEARS. To dream of ripe, mellow pears, portends elevation in
life, riches, honors, and constancy in love. If a woman with child
dream of them, she will have a daughter. To dream of unripe,
choke-pears, is a sign of misfortunes, and inconstancy in love.
33.</p>

<p><a id="PEDDLER"></a>PEDDLER. If you dream of buying things of a peddler, it is a
sign that some one will cheat you, or that one of your debtors will
mysteriously disappear, which amounts to about the same thing: if
a lady housekeeper dreams this, let her look sharp that her servants
do not rob or swindle her in some way. 42, 13.</p>

<p>PEN-KNIFE. To dream of a pen-knife, is a bad omen, and foretells
loss in trade, attacks by thieves, and unfaithfulness in love.
29, 47.</p>

<p><a id="PENS"></a>PENS. To dream of writing with a steel pen, is a sign you will
get yourself into a bad scrape, by tattling about your friends and
neighbors. If the pen be gold, it foreshadows good news, and success
in business and love affairs. To dream you are making a quill
pen, is a sign you have many enemies, but that you will triumph
over them, and be successful in all you undertake. But this dream
does not amount to much, as it is only a  “set-off” to dreaming of a
pen-knife, which is a bad omen. 28, 6.</p>

<p><a id="PEPPERS"></a>PEPPERS. To dream of picking pepper-pods, foretells to married
people smart children, if they have any. A girl who dreams this,
will have a smart man for a lover, but he will not pet her much
either as a sweetheart or wife. 9.</p>

<p><a id="PERFUMERY"></a>PERFUMERY. To dream of pleasant and delicate perfumes, foreshadows
sluttish habits in a woman: if a lover dreams of perfumes
in connection with the beloved object, it shows that when he marries,
he will find her to be a slut. A girl who dreams this, will be
apt to have a shiftless lover. 71, 1.</p>

<p><a id="PERJURY"></a>PERJURY. To dream that any one injures you by false swearing,
or by perjury in court, is a sign that you will discover some friend
or acquaintance to be dishonest, or guilty of a crime, or of mean
conduct; if a girl dream this, it is a similar omen relative to her
lover. 52.</p>

<p><a id="PET"></a>PET. If a girl dreams she has a pet animal of any kind, (a child,
of course, excepted,) it is a sign she will never marry: if she dreams
of a pet child, or one whom she adores, it foretells for her a prolific
marriage. 49.</p>

<p><a id="PHYSIC"></a>PHYSIC. (<i>See <a href="#MEDICINE">Medicine</a>.</i>) In a dream-book published 1751, is this
prediction:  “If any man doth dreme he taketh much physicke, it
foretelleth a bad lyver, and a quarell with ye doctor; but a virgin
who dremeth this dreme, will marry ye doctor first, and quarell
thereafter.” 37, 8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p><a id="PIANO"></a>PIANO. To dream of hearing pleasant and lively tunes on the
piano, is a sign of thrift and domestic happiness; but if you dream
of buying, or that any one presents you with a piano, it foreshadows
poverty; it is a bad omen for a girl to dream she has got a new
piano. 72.</p>

<p><a id="PICKLES"></a>PICKLES. If a girl dreams of eating pickles, it is a sign some old
bachelor will kiss her: if a young man dreams of pickles, he will be
beloved by a maid older than himself, and probably of a sour and
crabbed temper. 39, 2.</p>

<p><a id="PICNIC"></a>PICNIC. For a young man to dream of going with a pic-nic party
into the woods, is a sign that some silly girl will fall in love with
him: if a young girl dreams this, some vain fellow will probably pay
her attentions and compliments merely to gratify his own vanity.
37, 12.</p>

<p><a id="PICTURES"></a>PICTURES. To dream of seeing pictures is a sign of joy without
profit. 48, 7.</p>

<p><a id="PIES"></a>PIES. To dream of eating pie is a sign that you will soon be in
want. To dream you are making pies is a sign of pleasure and happiness.
38.</p>

<p><a id="PIGEONS"></a>PIGEONS. To dream of pigeons is a sign of content and delight,
and success in business. 39.</p>

<p><a id="PIGS"></a>PIGS. To dream of seeing pigs is good; if you are in trade you
will have great increase in your business from foreign parts; if you
are in love, your sweetheart is thereby denoted to be of a good temper,
faithful and sincere to you, and that if you marry you will become
happy. 4, 12, 48.</p>

<p><a id="PINEAPPLE"></a>PINEAPPLE. To dream of this fruit is a sign of gold; if you see
an abundance of it, you will receive plenty of gold soon after: a
young girl who dreams of pineapples will probably get a rich husband.
22, 9, 78.</p>

<p><a id="PINKS"></a>PINKS. If a lady dreams of pinks, it foretells she will soon have
a new bonnet that she will be delighted with: if a gentleman dreams
of them, his wife or sweetheart will get a new bonnet that will please
him. That’s all. 34.</p>

<p><a id="PINS"></a>PINS. To dream of pins signifies that you will have small troubles
all through life, but no great disasters; to dream you find a pin is a
sign of success in business; if a girl dream she is pricked with a pin,
she must keep a sharp look out for her lover or she may get in trouble.
3, 71.</p>

<p><a id="PIPE"></a>PIPE. To dream you smoke a pipe is an omen of success in business;
if the pipe goes out three times it is a sign you will meet with
losses. To dream you break a pipe foretells a quarrel that will injure
your prospects. 49, 7, 9.</p>

<p><a id="PIRATE"></a>PIRATE. To dream you are captured by pirates is a sign you will
travel in foreign countries and eventually make your fortune: if a
girl dreams this, it foretells that she will marry a foreigner who,
dying, will leave her a fortune. 6.</p>

<p>PISS-ABED. To dream that you wet the bed in your sleep, is a
sign you will lose something by fire: your house may not burn, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
some article will either fall in the fire or be damaged by it—perhaps
your servant may spoil some clothing while ironing. 5, 11, 55.</p>

<p><a id="PISTOL"></a>PISTOL. To dream of arming yourself with a pistol foretells that
you will lose <i>caste</i>, and perhaps become poor: if a girl dreams that
her lover carries a pistol, she may be sure that he is below her in
social life, and therefore an unpropitious or unsuitable match. 16,
21, 57.</p>

<p><a id="PITCH"></a>PITCH. To dream that you get pitch on your person is a sign that
some one has been scandalizing you by telling lies: a girl who dreams
this, may be sure that her fair fame has been questioned somewhere.
54, 14.</p>

<p><a id="PITCHER"></a>PITCHER. (<i>See Jug.</i>) To dream you drink water or milk from a
pitcher is a good omen, and signifies you will be prosperous in love
and business. To dream you spill anything out of a pitcher foretells
losses from the treachery of supposed friends, and to dream you break
a pitcher portends sickness, and accident while on a journey. To
dream of breaking a pitcher is also a sign of bankruptcy through
carelessness. 49, 20.</p>

<p><a id="PLAINS"></a>PLAINS. To dream of being on a beautiful plain signifies health,
happiness and riches, but portends some crosses in love. 4, 12, 48.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Dreams of wandering over plains,</div>
   <div class="verse">Walking in cross ways and lanes,</div>
   <div class="verse">And being in thick woods quite lost,</div>
   <div class="verse">Declare that lovers shall be crost.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="PLANTS"></a>PLANTS. (<i>See <a href="#BLOSSOMS">Blossom</a>.</i>) To dream of healthy, thriving plants is a
good omen, as it foretells success in life, and smart children: such a
dream is an excellent one for lovers, as it denotes an early and happy
marriage. 43, 14, 7.</p>

<p><a id="PLASTER"></a>PLASTER. For a girl to dream of having a plaster on her person
is a sign that some one will offer her an insult, or perhaps make an
attempt upon her chastity: if a man dreams this, the same will probably
happen to his wife or sweetheart. 72, 8.</p>

<p><a id="PLENTY"></a>PLENTY. (<i>See <a href="#ABUNDANCE">Abundance</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="PLOW"></a>PLOW. (<i>See <a href="#HUSBANDRY">Husbandry</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="PLOWING"></a>PLOWING. For a farmer to dream that he is plowing on smooth
and even ground, denotes heavy crops, and good luck generally: if
he plows up stones it is all the better, but if his plow gets hitched
into a rock or stump, it denotes vexation and trouble with his good
luck. 41.</p>

success in business. 19, 78.</p>

<p><a id="POET"></a>POET. If any young person should be so silly as to dream of writing
poetry, it foretells poverty; and for one to dream of having a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
poetical lover or sweetheart, is a sign that they will fall in love with
a fool. 64, 50.</p>

<p><a id="POISON"></a>POISON. To dream that you are poisoned is a sign you will get
into bad or unworthy company: if you imagine that any friend or
acquaintance is poisoned, it is a similar omen as regards them: if, in
your dream, you think any one has given you poison to murder you,
it foretells that some base proposal will be made to you. 3, 9.</p>

<p>POLE-CAT. If a man dream he sees one, he will marry a beautiful
woman; if a woman, she will marry a handsome man. If this delightful
animal make an attack on you it is a sign you will suffer
from the slander of enemies. 68, 2.</p>

<p><a id="POLICE"></a>POLICE. If any respectable person dreams of being arrested by
police officers, it is a sign that some distinguished honor will be conferred
on him: if a young girl should dream that policemen took her
lover into custody, she will hear of his advancement in the world.
46, 30.</p>

<p><a id="POLITE"></a>POLITE. To dream of polite people is a sign that a stranger will

<p><a id="PORTRAIT"></a>PORTRAIT. To dream of having your portrait taken, is a sign
some one will compliment your good looks; but if you are dissatisfied
and think it a bad likeness, the compliment will run in a contrary
direction, and you will be called frightfully ugly-looking behind your
back. 12.</p>

<p><a id="POUND"></a>POUND. For a farmer to dream that any of his cattle are taken to
pound, is a sign that they will increase: if he dreams of seeing
strange cattle in a pound, it foretells that he will soon buy some.
19, 55.</p>

<p><a id="PRAISE"></a>PRAISE. To dream that any one praises or flatters you, is a sign
of scandal: if a girl dreams that her lover praises her good looks or
amiability, she bad better discard him as a false-hearted person who
cares nothing about her, but is merely flattering his own vanity. 35, 17.</p>

<p><a id="PRAYER"></a>PRAYER. To dream of prayer, or of joining in a prayer with
others, is a sign you will ask a favor of some one who will refuse
you: if you dream of hearing prayers at church, or in any public
place, it shows that you will be requested to do something which you
will refuse to do, and thereby make an enemy. 34, 77.</p>

<p><a id="PREGNANCY"></a>PREGNANCY. For a woman to dream that she is pregnant when
she is not, is a sign of some special good fortune; she will either
have a handsome present, or else her husband will be lucky in some
business transaction and give her a part of the money: if a girl dreams
this, it foretells that she will get married about as sudden as if the
dream were a reality. 4, 11, 44.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p><a id="PRESENT"></a>PRESENT. (<i>See <a href="#GIFT">Gift</a>.</i>) To dream of receiving a present, is usually
a sign of disappointment; but if a married woman dreams that she is
presented with fruit, it shows that she will soon become pregnant: if
a girl imagines she is presented by her lover with gold jewelry, it
predicts that he covets the possession of her person rather than her
heart. 64, 21.</p>

<p><a id="PRESERVES"></a>PRESERVES. To dream that you make or eat them, foretells the
acquisition of much money and property, also health and happiness.
3, 33, 9.</p>

<p><a id="PRETTY"></a>PRETTY GIRL. For a young man to dream of admiring a pretty
girl, is a sign he will marry a simpleton: if a girl dreams she has a
nice and pretty-looking lover, she will be apt to take up with a putty-head.
Here is an ancient rhyming prediction: 4, 13.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">To dream you love a girl who’s pretty,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Foretells that you’ll in sorrow part;</div>
   <div class="verse">But if you dream she’s wise and witty,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">She’ll be the darling of your heart!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="PRICK"></a>PRICK. If a lady dreams of pricking her finger while sewing, she
must put it in her mouth on awaking, and make a wish, and she will
realize it within one month, provided it relates to love matters: a wish
of any other kind will doubtless come true some time or other, as
the omen is an excellent one: if a lady dreams she pricks herself with
a pin, the omen is not so good. (<i>See <a href="#PINS">Pin</a> and <a href="#BRIARS">Briar</a>.</i>) 498.</p>

<p><a id="PRIEST"></a>PRIEST. To dream that a priest offers you service, or visits you
for any purpose, is a sign that you will be robbed; if you dream you
go to one for advice, it foretells that some misfortune will overtake
you: any dream about a priest is a bad one. 39.</p>

<p><a id="PRISON"></a>PRISON. (<i>See <a href="#JAIL">Jail</a>.</i>) To dream you are put in prison, foretells that
honor awaits you: but this omen does not apply to rogues or dishonest
people, though such a dream by them favors their desires: if a
girl dreams that her lover has gone to prison, she will soon hear of
his advancement. 46.</p>

<p><a id="PRIZE"></a>PRIZE. To dream of drawing a prize in the lottery, is a sign of
poverty and misery: if you dream that you bought a lottery ticket
with a majority of odd numbers on it, you may perchance be successful
with those numbers, but even numbers are worthless in dreams.
To dream of getting prizes in any way is a bad omen. 4, 11, 44.</p>

<p><a id="PROCESSION"></a>PROCESSION. To dream of seeing a long military or civic procession,
is a sign that some of your friends will come to poverty and ask
your assistance; if you imagine that you are in such a procession
yourself, it foretells that you will either make a loss, or be very short
of money. 2.</p>

<p><a id="PROFIT"></a>PROFIT. If a man dreams that he made a large and liberal profit
by any transaction or speculation, it foretells losses and disaster.
48, 16.</p>

<p><a id="PROMISE"></a>PROMISE. To dream of broken promises on the part of a friend,
is a sign that he will confer a benefit on you: if a girl dreams that
her lover has broken his promise to marry, it foreshadows a speedy
performance of the ceremony. 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p><a id="PROPERTY"></a>PROPERTY. To dream of the loss of property, is a sign of good
luck, and you may calculate to acquire as much as you dreamed was
lost, for such dreams always work contrariwise. 45, 1, 14.</p>

<p><a id="PROSTITUTE"></a>PROSTITUTE. For a young man to dream of associating with
prostitutes, is a sign of poverty and disgrace: if he dreams of seeing
these girls anywhere, it foretells misfortune or bad luck: for a girl to
dream of them, is a sign that her chastity is in danger. 35, 9.</p>

<p><a id="PROUD"></a>PROUD. To dream of proud people who disgust you, foretells that
you will rise in the world: a girl who dreams this of her lover, will
probably marry a rich or distinguished man. 3, 32, 13.</p>

<p><a id="PUDDING"></a>PUDDING. To dream of a hard-boiled plum pudding, or a hard
roll of pudding of any kind, is a sign you will be invited to a dinner
party; but if you imagine the pudding looks soft and mussy, it foretells
that you will go to some entertainment where there will be a
row. 19, 70.</p>

<p><a id="PULPIT"></a>PULPIT. If any one dreams of going into a pulpit, it is a sign he
or she will visit a place of disrepute, as such dreams work contrariwise:
for a girl to dream that she assists in ornamenting or dressing
a pulpit, foretells that she will do some act that she afterwards regrets,
because of an unworthy person being connected therewith. 62.</p>

<p><a id="PUMP"></a>PUMP. Dreaming of a pump is an excellent omen: if you dream
of pumping clear water from one, it shows that you will have good
luck in business, or in a speculation: pumping dirty water is a sign
of sickness. 29, 4, 20.</p>

<p><a id="PUNCH"></a>PUNCH. To dream of making this beverage, or of drinking it, is
a sign of poverty or disgrace; if a girl dreams that her lover treats
her to punch, she had better discard him at once, as he will undoubtedly
turn out to be a poor and shiftless fellow. 19, 32.</p>

<p><a id="PUNISHMENT"></a>PUNISHMENT. (<i>See <a href="#STICK">Stick</a>.</i>) To dream of punishing a child, foretells
good fortune to the victim, and honors to yourself. For any
one to dream of being punished by whipping, is a sign they will rise
in the world, or be honored for some act. 7.</p>

<p><a id="PURSE"></a>PURSE. To dream of finding an empty purse, shadows forth disappointment;
if the purse has plenty of money in it, your luck will
be excellent—the more money, the better fortune: if it has in it
large gold pieces, or large bills, you will become rich either by marriage
or inheritance. 78.</p>

<p><a id="PUTTY"></a>PUTTY. To dream of putty, is a sign of poverty: puttying up
holes foretells losses—the larger the hole, the more extensive the
loss. If you are putting glass into a window with putty, it foretells
that you will soon remove into a meaner place than you now occupy.
6, 4.</p>

<p><a id="PUZZLE"></a>PUZZLE. To dream of bothering your brains with a puzzle, foretells
frivolity; if you succeed, you will do something that works to
your disadvantage: if you imagine that the puzzle puzzles you, it is
a sign that some silly person will do you an unintentional injury.
21, 17.</p>

<p><a id="QUAIL"></a>QUAIL. To dream of these birds is a good omen: if you imagine
you see young quail feeding, it is a sign of thrift, particularly to far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>mers:
to be successful in shooting them in the proper season, also
foretells good luck and success in any undertaking. 76, 14.</p>

<p><a id="QUAKER"></a>QUAKER. To dream of business intercourse with genuine broad-brims,
is a sign you will make a bad bargain. If, in your dream,
you see a concourse of quakers, it foretells that you will not be fortunate
in business matters. This omen is supposed to be predicated
on the fact that the Quakers monopolize all the good chances when
they are around. 24, 30.</p>

<p><a id="QUARREL"></a>QUARREL. To dream of quarreling with a stranger, is a sign
you will make a new friend or acquaintance; if you imagine that you
quarrel with a friend, it shows that you will soon have a pleasant
and agreeable time with him: lovers who dream of quarrels, will be
apt to bill and coo harder than ever. 2, 12, 24.</p>

<p><a id="QUEEN"></a>QUEEN. For a man to dream of seeing a queen, foretells the loss
of money, either by robbery or bad debts: if he is presented to a
queen, the dream is still worse in respect to losses. 39, 60.</p>

<p><a id="QUICKSILVER"></a>QUICKSILVER. (<i>See <a href="#METALS">Metals</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="QUILTING"></a>QUILTING. If a lady dreams of going to a quilting party, it foretells
for her and her family thrift and good luck: gentlemen, who
dream of being much entertained at such a party, will have the very
best success in love matters. 71, 54.</p>

<p><a id="QUINCES"></a>QUINCES. To dream of quinces, is an excellent omen: if you
imagine you are gathering quinces from trees full of fine-looking, yellow
ones, it predicts that you will get just so much yellow gold,
which will be a fortune. 49, 6.</p>

<p><a id="QUOITS"></a>QUOITS. If a man dreams he is playing quoits, it is a sign he will
soon have a quarrel. If a woman dreams she is playing quoits, it
foretells she will have much trouble through life. To dream of quoits,
is not a good omen to lovers. 57, 3.</p>

<p><a id="RABBITS"></a>RABBITS. To dream of these animals, foretells many small children:
if a newly married woman dreams of them it is a sign that she will
have twins or triplets within a year: such a dream will not be very
pleasant to a young girl unless she means to marry right sudden, for
rabbits do not predict anything else but breeding children. 44, 13.</p>

<p><a id="RACCOON"></a>RACCOON. To dream of simply treeing a raccoon, is a good omen,
for you will probably either gain a sum of money, or have it left to
you as a legacy: if you imagine that you shoot the animal, and he
falls to the ground, this will spoil the luck; you should stop dreaming
as soon as the ’coon is up the tree. 61, 12.</p>

<p><a id="RACES"></a>RACES. (<i>See <a href="#RUN">Run</a>.</i>) To dream of running a race on foot and winning
it, is a sign of success in any undertaking—losing it, foretells
disappointment. If you dream of going to a horse-race, it predicts
poverty and shiftlessness. 46, 7.</p>

<p><a id="RADISHES"></a>RADISHES. To dream of this vegetable, signifies that a secret
will be discovered, which will occasion a muss in the family. To a
girl, it is a sign she will lose her beau, and to a lover, it foreshadows
he will be  “cut out” by some other nice young man. 38, 13.</p>

<p><a id="RAFFLE"></a>RAFFLE. Raffling in your dream is the same as gambling; it
foretells poverty and disgrace: to dream of raffling for poultry is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
sign that your family (if you have one) will want bread; if you are
single, it shows that you will be apt to get seedy and loaferish. 8, 44.</p>

<p><a id="RAFT"></a>RAFT. To dream of seeing a raft foretells a journey—the longer
the raft, the more extensive the line of travel: if you dream of sailing
on a raft, it is a sign you will travel, with good success, in distant
countries. 10.</p>

<p><a id="RAGE"></a>RAGE. (<i>See <a href="#ANGER">Anger</a>.</i>) If you dream that you are in a great rage in
consequence of a mishap, or disagreeable event, it is a sign that some
pleasant episode in connection therewith will occur to put you in an
excellent humor, as such dreams work contrariwise. 44, 16.</p>

<p><a id="RAGGED"></a>RAGGED. To dream that your clothes are ragged, indicates that
a young girl will banter you: if, in your dream, you see ragged people,
it is a sign that you will suffer ridicule at your next meeting
with a party of ladies and gentlemen. Rags and ridicule go together
in dreams. 19.</p>

<p><a id="RAILROAD"></a>RAILROAD. To dream of traveling by railroad, foretells to people
who keep house that they will break up their establishment: to
young persons it indicates the loss of their home: to lovers it is a
sign that if they marry they will not keep house long, if at all. 3,
11, 33.</p>

<p><a id="RAIN"></a>RAIN. To dream of a gentle rain is a good omen, as it foretells
success in any undertaking: if you dream of a violent rain-storm
accompanied by wind and thunder and lightning, it predicts much
trouble and misfortune, though ultimate success in your undertakings.
21, 72.</p>

<p><a id="RAINBOW"></a>RAINBOW. It is an excellent dream to imagine you see a brilliant
rainbow—the brighter the better: it denotes health and general prosperity:
to lovers it foretells a happy marriage, and riches. A young
girl who dreams of a rainbow will either get an agreeable lover or a
present. 45.</p>

<p><a id="RAKING"></a>RAKING. For a girl to dream of raking newly mown hay, is a
sign she will be married before the hay is eaten: young fellows who
dream of raking hay with their sweethearts had better get ready
their necks for the matrimonial noose, as they are past praying for.
4, 11.</p>

<p><a id="RAM"></a>RAM. To dream that a ram runs at you for butting purposes,
shadows forth to a young man that his society will be coveted by
the girls, and that he will be fortunate in love matters generally: if
a girl dreams this, she will probably have her choice of lovers, as all
the young fellows around there will fall in love with her: if the ram
succeeds in butting her, she will surely be taken captive and brought
as Cupid’s prisoner into the matrimonial ranks. 19.</p>

<p><a id="RAPE"></a>RAPE. If a female (married or single) dreams of an outrage on her
person, (whether attempted, or successful,) it is a sign that some one
of the opposite sex is in love with her: if she is married, the dream
alludes to some man other than her husband. Such dreams bode no
good. 31.</p>

<p><a id="RASPBERRIES"></a>RASPBERRIES. To dream of an abundance of this fruit is a sign
of health and riches: if you dream you are eating raspberries, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
shows that you will be engaged in some enterprise that will bring
you in a good deal of cash, most of which will be spent lavishly. 3,
66.</p>

<p><a id="RATS"></a>RATS. (<i>See <a href="#TRAP">Trap</a> and <a href="#MOUSE">Mouse</a>.</i>) To dream of rats is a sign that
thieves are around: if you see any of these animals, it shows that
some friend will be robbed, but if you hear them gnawing, you will
suffer a loss from robbery yourself. If a girl, who has a lover, dreams
of rats, she had better be careful and not let him be too free with her
person, or he may rob her of that which cannot be restored. 54, 21.</p>

<p><a id="RAVEN"></a>RAVEN. (<i>See <a href="#CROW">Crow</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="READING"></a>READING. To dream you are reading, indicates you will be successful
in your love; in trade, it is particularly propitious; but if it
appear to be painful or irksome to read, it signifies that you shall not
succeed without exertion, 65, 2.</p>

<p><a id="REAPING"></a>REAPING. (<i>See <a href="#HARVEST">Harvest</a>.</i>) To dream of reaping grain is an excellent
omen, as it foretells thrift and abundance, as well as plenty of
money in gold; this applies to a prolific field of ripe yellow grain; if
the grain is meagre and looks rusty, the sign is entirely different, as
it betokens scarcity and penury. 4, 11, 44.</p>

<p><a id="RELATIONS"></a>RELATIONS. If you dream of being annoyed at home by your
relations, it is a sign that you will be the subject of much scandal:
if, on the contrary, you imagine that your relatives visit you and give
you great pleasure by their society, it foretells that you are talked
about a good deal, but always with respect and veneration. 70.</p>

<p><a id="RELIGIOUS"></a>RELIGIOUS. For any one to dream of becoming religious, foretells
that they will be cheated or swindled in some way, as such a dream
works contrariwise: if you dream that a minister, or any religious
person, exhorts you to become pious, you had better look out sharp,
for some rogue is around, contriving how to victimize you. 54.</p>

<p><a id="RENT"></a>RENT. To dream of paying your rent foretells that you will get
some money unexpectedly; but if you dream that you owe it, without
having the money to pay, and are worried in consequence, it
foreshadows a loss of property. 3.</p>

<p><a id="REPRIEVE"></a>REPRIEVE. If a criminal under sentence of death dream of a
reprieve or pardon, he may make up his mind that it is all over with
him; and if any friend, who is interested in his fate, dreams this, it
amounts to about the same thing. 76, 5.</p>

<p><a id="REPTILE"></a>REPTILE. To dream of any animal that is called a reptile, such
as snakes, toads, alligators, and the like, is a sign of a quarrel: if you
imagine you are bitten, it shows that you will come out second best,
or badly injured either in person or reputation. If a girl dreams of
a reptile, let her look sharp that her lover don’t play her false. 34, 3.</p>

<p><a id="RESCUE"></a>RESCUE. If you dream of rescuing anyone from peril, it is a sign
you will rise in the world, either by means of increased wealth, or
new honors: to dream that you are rescued from drowning or from
any other mode of death, shows that you will go into some successful
business speculation with a partner. To lovers, such a dream foretells
a speedy and happy union. 64, 9.</p>

<p><a id="RESIGN"></a>RESIGN. If a person who holds an office, or a trust of any kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
dreams of resigning, it is a sign of advancement: to any one who
cannot be advanced, it shows that he will rise above his present
position in society. 41, 17.</p>

<p><a id="RESUSCITATE"></a>RESUSCITATE. To dream of resuscitating a drowned person,
foretells that you will engage in some enterprise that attracts public
attention: if the person thus brought to life is a female, it shadows
forth marriage with a lady of public fame. 16, 9, 78.</p>

<p><a id="REVENGE"></a>REVENGE. To dream of revenging an injury, is a sign of disgrace:
if, in your dream, you imagine that you have caused any one
to be locked up in prison from motives of revenge, it predicts that
you yourself will be imprisoned for some degrading act. 74, 50.</p>

<p><a id="REVIVAL"></a>REVIVAL. To dream of a religious revival, or of being where a
great many people are holding a revival meeting, is a sign that you
will go into a disreputable public place and lose <i>caste</i>: if you take
part in the meeting, it foretells that you will come to disgrace, as all
such dreams work contrariwise. 13, 57.</p>

<p><a id="REWARD"></a>REWARD. To dream of receiving a reward for any act which is
a public benefit, such as detecting a criminal, is a sign that you will
have honors conferred upon you: if you dream of getting a reward
for finding money or other property, it foreshadows good fortune and
riches. 41.</p>

<p><a id="RHEUMATISM"></a>RHEUMATISM. To dream of this painful disease, is an omen of
health: if you imagine a friend is thus afflicted, it shows that he
will soon offer to do you a favor, or benefit you in some way. 52, 16.</p>

<p><a id="RHINOCEROS"></a>RHINOCEROS. To dream of this East India animal, denotes success
to the man of business, but disappointment in love matters; but
to dream they injure you, is unfavorable to the dreamer. If you
dream you see one dead, you’ll soon leave a relative. 47.</p>

<p><a id="RIBBONS"></a>RIBBONS. For a girl to dream that she has got new, and beautiful
ribbons on her bonnet or dress, is a sign some one will flatter her to
her disadvantage: if she does not like the ribbon, it shows that she
will hear of some scandal relative to herself; and if the ribbon is
red, the scandal will impeach her chastity. 39, 6.</p>

<p><a id="RICE"></a>RICE. To dream of eating rice, denotes health: if you imagine
that you see large quantities of rice, it foretells to one who does not
live in a rice country, a successful and pleasant journey; and to
those who live there, it predicts gain and riches. 12, 2, 24.</p>

<p><a id="RICH"></a>RICH. To dream you are rich or that you have inherited a fortune,
is a sign of poverty and bad luck; but if you imagine that
some one pays you large sums of money enough to make you rich,
your dream will be realized so far that you will acquire property. If
a person dreams that a legacy is paid to him in money, it has an entirely
different meaning from a dream that you are enriched from a
legacy, but do not see the money. 15, 3.</p>

<p><a id="RIDING"></a>RIDING. (<i>See Carriage, Stage-coach, and Gig.</i>) To dream you are
riding, if it be with a woman, is unfortunate: in trade, decay of business;
in love, disappointments; but if it be with men, then, by care,
the reverse of these things will happen. Riding in a railcar, or a
stage, foretells success in business matters. 6, 12, 72.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p><a id="RING"></a>RING. For a lady to dream that a gentleman presents her with a
ring, or that she has a ring belonging to a gentleman, is a sign of a
wedding. If a young man dreams that he has got a lady’s ring, the
omen is similar. To dream of finding a ring, foretells that the person
finding it will marry within a year. 4, 20.</p>

<p><a id="RIOT"></a>RIOT. To dream of a public tumult or riot, is a sign of scarcity
and bad crops to farmers, and dull business to tradesmen and mechanics:
if any friend or relative is injured in the riot, you or they
will probably suffer from misfortune, but if they are successful and
pacify the crowd, it foretells that you will overcome your difficulties.
2.</p>

<p><a id="RIVAL"></a>RIVAL. For a lover to dream that he has a rival who annoys him,
is a sign that he is in high favor with his sweetheart; such a dream
to a young lady has a similar omen, and she has only to name the
happy day to settle the matter to her mind. 1, 70.</p>

<p><a id="RIVER"></a>RIVER. To dream of crossing a large and clear river, foretells a
splendid fortune: if the water is muddy or riled, it predicts difficulties,
but they will be overcome provided you get safe over the river
without accident. If a girl dreams this, it is a sign she will travel
somewhere and get a rich husband. 34, 20.</p>

<p><a id="ROBBERY"></a>ROBBERY. (<i>See <a href="#THIEF">Thief</a> and <a href="#STEALING">Stealing</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="ROBIN"></a>ROBIN. To dream of seeing robins around your house, is a good
omen, as it foretells abundance to farmers and success to any one; if
you do not see them, but hear them trilling, it foreshadows sickness,
and perhaps death. 6.</p>

<p><a id="ROCKET"></a>ROCKET. To dream of seeing rockets flying in the air, foretells
joy and gladness at some event about to happen: to married people
it denotes the birth of a child, or the marriage of a daughter if they
have one old enough. If a young girl dreams of seeing a rocket,
she needn’t trouble herself further, as her speedy marriage is certain.
15.</p>

<p>ROCKING-CHAIR. (<i>See <a href="#CHAIR">Chair</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="ROCKS"></a>ROCKS. (<i>See <a href="#MOUNTAIN">Mountain</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="ROOSTER"></a>ROOSTER. (<i>See <a href="#COCK">Cock</a>.</i>) If a girl dreams of hearing a cock crow,
it foretells that she will soon have a new lover; if a lover dreams
this, it is a sign that he has a formidable rival: if a married man or
woman dreams of roosters, it shows that some outsider is enamored
of the wife. 10, 19.</p>

<p><a id="ROSE"></a>ROSE. To dream of roses is a sign of troubles: the old saying
that every rose has its thorn, is exemplified in such a dream, because
every rose you see brings along a trouble: dreaming of white roses
signifies a marriage which will bring much vexation. 47, 9.</p>

<p><a id="ROSEMARY"></a>ROSEMARY. To the married, denotes loss of their mates and
children; to the lover, trouble through his or her sweetheart. 49, 7.</p>

<p><a id="ROTTEN"></a>ROTTEN. To dream of rotten things of any kind (except eggs),
foretells sickness and death: to imagine that you handle rotten eggs,
foreshadows disgrace. 35.</p>

<p><a id="ROWING"></a>ROWING. To dream of rowing a boat in clear water, is a sign of
good luck generally: if the water is muddy, it shows trouble and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
difficulties which may be overcome; if a lover dreams of rowing
a boat with his lady-love in it, he will doubtless make a happy
match, 20.</p>

<p><a id="RUDDER"></a>RUDDER. To dream of a broken rudder in a boat or vessel in
which you are sailing, foretells that one of the persons who you
imagine are in the boat, will be drowned, or come to a sudden death.
27, 75.</p>

<p><a id="RUIN"></a>RUIN. If you dream that you are looking at old ruins, or castles,
or buildings, it is a sign you will travel in distant countries: to
dream of the ruins of a house that has been burnt down, foretells
that you will experience a loss of property: if, in your dream, you
see the ruins of a house that has fallen down, it denotes the death
of a friend or acquaintance. 5, 12, 60.</p>

<p><a id="RUN"></a>RUN. (<i>See <a href="#RACES">Race</a>.</i>) To dream of running swift, is a sign of good
success in your undertakings; but if you stumble or fall, it denotes
accidents or misfortune: if you imagine that you see people run,
while you are still, it foretells disappointment. 7.</p>

<p><a id="RUST"></a>RUST. To dream of rust is a bad omen: rusty knives, or tools of
any kind, denote the destruction of property: rusty pails or utensils
are so many signs of poverty. 54.</p>

<p><a id="RYE"></a>RYE. To dream of this grain is a sign you will be fortunate in
money matters; it also foretells success in love affairs: to the married
it foreshadows domestic happiness. 69.</p>

<p><a id="SAFFRON"></a>SAFFRON. To dream of gathering saffron, or of drinking a decoction
of the herb, is a sign of health and wealth: if the flowers that
you gather look clear and healthy, it foretells that you will get just so
much gold. 19, 24.</p>

<p><a id="SAILING"></a>SAILING. To dream of fair sailing on clear water, is an excellent
omen, as it foretells abundance and success: heavy winds that endanger
your boat, or muddy waters, point out difficulties which will
probably be overcome. (<i>See <a href="#BOAT">Boat</a>, <a href="#YACHT">Yacht</a> and <a href="#SHIP">Ship</a>.</i>) 20.</p>

<p><a id="SAUSAGES"></a>SAUSAGES. To dream of eating fried sausages, foretells that you
will come in contact with some person who is very poor, and
will be disagreeable to you: a girl who dreams this, will be very sure
to get a shiftless and needy lover, and perhaps marry him if she is
in much of a hurry to get married. 38, 16.</p>

<p><a id="SAWING"></a>SAWING. To dream of sawing wood, or boards, foretells that you
will do something that you will afterwards regret: if a young fellow
dreams this, he will probably offer some indignity to his sweetheart,
which he will find it hard work to get overlooked. 3, 17, 55.</p>

<p><a id="SCAFFOLD"></a>SCAFFOLD. To dream of going upon a high scaffold, shows that
you will rise in the world: if, in your dream, you imagine that you
fall from a scaffold, or from any high place, it shadows forth a misfortune
that will make you poorer: a girl who dreams of climbing upon
a scaffold, will positively marry a rich man, or one of distinction, who
is far above her in position. 33, 7.</p>

<p><a id="SCALDED"></a>SCALDED. To dream of being scalded with hot water, is usually a
sign of injuries by the elements; it may foretell losses by floods, by
fire, or by winds, or by thunder-storms: if you dream of scalding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
your tongue with hot tea, it is a sign that you will scandalize a neighbor
with some ill-natured remark. 3, 12, 36.</p>

<p><a id="SCALES"></a>SCALES. To dream you are weighing any article, is a good omen,
and signifies that you will be happy and long-lived; but to dream
you see another using the scales, is a sign you will be ruined by law-suits.
68, 40.</p>

<p><a id="SCARCITY"></a>SCARCITY. To dream of a scarcity of anything is a sign that some
of the article dreamed about is on its way to you; as if a farmer were
to dream of a scarcity of hay, it shows that his next hay crop will be
very abundant; or, if a girl should dream of a scarcity of compliments,
she will probably be overwhelmed by them from gentlemen, when
she next goes into company. 27, 9.</p>

<p><a id="SCHOOL"></a>SCHOOL. To dream of attending school, is a sign of advancement
and good fortune: if you dream of studying, and succeed well, it
shadows forth that you will rise to a position in society above your
present one: if you find it difficult to learn, you will have trouble in
getting along, but will rise at last. 42, 72.</p>

<p><a id="SCISSORS"></a>SCISSORS. To dream of a pair of scissors, is a sign of a marriage;
if a girl dreams of them she will positively be married within a year:
to a married woman such a dream is a bad omen, as it denotes some
gay seducer will flatter her, and probably succeed in enticing her
from the path of virtue. Here is an old prediction in rhyme: 47.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">To dream of scissors—a full pair,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Tells a fair maid that soon she’ll marry;</div>
  <div class="verse">But to a wife it doth declare</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Her chastity will e’en miscarry!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="SCOLD"></a>SCOLD. For a man to dream he has a scolding, shrewish wife, is
a sign that he will be lucky in everything he undertakes: if a lover
dreams that his sweetheart scolds at him, it is a sign that her love is
strong and unalterable. 65, 16.</p>

<p><a id="SCRATCH"></a>SCRATCH. To dream of having your face scratched, is a sign that
somebody has been disparaging your good looks: if a girl imagines
in her dream that she has scratched herself with a pin, it foretells
that scandal is afloat relative to her conduct with her lover, or some
other gentleman. 3.</p>

<p><a id="SCREW"></a>SCREW. To dream of a small screw, is a good sign, and indicates
success in all you undertake; but to dream of a large bed-screw portends
trouble brought about by love affairs. 4, 11, 44.</p>

<p><a id="SCYTHE"></a>SCYTHE. (<i>See <a href="#HUSBANDRY">Husbandry</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="SEA"></a>SEA. To dream of going to sea in a ship or steamer, is a sign that
you will be fortunate in money matters: storms and perils at sea foretell
difficulties which may be overcome: if you dream you are seasick,
it denotes continued health. If a girl dreams of going to sea,
and having a pleasant voyage, she will marry rich, and love her husband;
but storms and perils point to quarrels with him. 6.</p>

<p><a id="SECRET"></a>SECRET. If a young girl dreams that a friend has intrusted her
with an important secret, it is a sign that the friend will become her
enemy: if her lover tells her a secret, they will surely quarrel within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
a week; if she dreams of disclosing a secret to a friend, she will be
much vexed at some scandal that is afloat respecting her. 4, 2, 8.</p>

<p><a id="SEDUCER"></a>SEDUCER. If a young woman dreams that her lover’s conduct is
that of a gay seducer, she will find him to be very sincere in his attachment:
a married woman who dreams that she is over-persuaded
by a seducer to yield to his desires, will come to much honor, as such
dreams work contrariwise. If a man dreams of seducing a virtuous
girl, it foreshadows that he will be disgraced. 35, 8.</p>

<p><a id="SEGAR"></a>SEGAR. (<i>See <a href="#TOBACCO">Tobacco</a>.</i>) To dream you are smoking a segar, is a
sign you will have misfortunes and troubles with your business matters:
if you imagine the fire of your segar goes out, it is a sign you will
meet with losses: in love matters this dream is a bad omen. 49, 7, 9.</p>

<p><a id="SEPARATION"></a>SEPARATION. If a woman dreams that she is about to live separate
from her husband, it promises that she will shortly find herself
in the family way: such a dream to a man is a sign that some woman
or girl, other than his wife, is in love with him. 26, 17.</p>

<p><a id="SERVANTS"></a>SERVANTS. (<i>See <a href="#DOMESTICS">Domestics</a>.</i>) To dream that you are robbed by
your servants, is a sign that some one among them that you think
the most of is deceiving you: if, in your dream, you imagine you
have had your silver stolen by a servant, it shows that you will have
a difficulty, and discharge one who will be replaced by a dishonest
person. 71, 40, 11.</p>

<p><a id="SHARK"></a>SHARK. To dream of seeing a shark in the water, is an excellent
omen, as it foretells that you will escape a great danger that menaces
you: if you dream of capturing the shark, you will soon thereafter
get a big lump of money. Catching fish of any kind foretells money-getting.
31.</p>

<p><a id="SHAVE"></a>SHAVE. For a man to dream that he is shaving, is a sign he will
get in debt: to dream that any one shaved you in a bargain, foretells
that some debt will be paid to you which you had given up as lost.
5, 7, 54.</p>

<p><a id="SHAWL"></a>SHAWL. If a girl dreams of getting a new shawl, it foretells that
she will soon have a new beau who will be very attentive and affable.
3, 19.</p>

<p><a id="SHEEP"></a>SHEEP. To dream of large flocks of sheep, is a sign of thrift and
abundance, particularly to farmers, to whom the omen promises large
crops: if many of the sheep have young lambs, it foretells domestic
happiness and an excellent crop of children. 12, 5, 60.</p>

<p><a id="SHELL"></a>SHELL. (<i>See <a href="#OYSTERS">Oysters</a> and <a href="#CLAMS">Clams</a>.</i>) To dream you find an empty
shell is a sign you will meet with losses in business, but if, in your
dream, you imagine the shell to be full, it foretells you will be successful
in all your undertakings. If you dream you are opening any kind
of shell fish for others to eat it foreshadows that you will have plenty
of funds. 19, 53.</p>

<p><a id="SHERIFF"></a>SHERIFF. If you dream the sheriff is after you with a writ, or a
warrant, and that you dodge and escape him, it is a sign of bad luck
and losses; but if he arrests and locks you up in prison, it foretells
that some good fortune is coming. Soon after such a dream you will
be lucky in anything you undertake. 62, 21.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p><a id="SHIFT"></a>SHIFT. (<i>See <a href="#LINEN">Linen</a> and <a href="#SMOCK">Smock</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="SHIP"></a>SHIP. To dream of seeing a ship under full sail, while you stand
on the shore, is a sign you will soon fall in love with a pretty girl,
who will favor your addresses; but if you see this ship while you
are on the water in some other vessel, it shows that your sweetheart
will be jealous of you. To dream of being shipwrecked and losing
your property, foretells good luck in business matters, but quarrels
in love affairs. 29, 8.</p>

<p><a id="SHIRT"></a>SHIRT. To dream that your shirt is ragged and without buttons,
is a sign of poverty: if you imagine that you have a new shirt, with
a stylish bosom, it foretells some disagreeable adventure in which
your self-esteem will be keenly wounded, such as being placed in a
ridiculous position before ladies, or before company in public. 44, 18.</p>

<p><a id="SHOES"></a>SHOES. (<i>See <a href="#BOOTS">Boots</a>.</i>) If you dream that one of your shoes has a
hole in it, it foretells that your sweetheart will offend you by favoring
a supposed rival: if a girl dreams this, her lover will be jealous of
her: for a young man to dream that he has lost a shoe-string, is a
sign that he will be kissed by a lady with whom he had no previous
acquaintance. 33.</p>

<p><a id="SHROUD"></a>SHROUD. (<i>See <a href="#CORPSE">Corpse</a>.</i>) To dream of a shroud is a sign of a wedding:
to see, in your dream, a woman laid out in her shroud, foretells
to a young person that he or she will either be present at a
marriage, or will become a victim of Cupid’s archery. 39, 11.</p>

<p><a id="SICKNESS"></a>SICKNESS. (<i>See <a href="#DISEASE">Disease</a>.</i>) If you dream you have had a long sickness,
and are recovering, it foretells bad luck and difficulties: should
you imagine that you are sick and are going to die, the omen is the
reverse, for some good fortune awaits you: if a girl dreams that she
is sick abed, and her lover visits her, it foretells a smooth courtship
and happy marriage. 2.</p>

<p><a id="SILKS"></a>SILKS. For a lady to dream of silks and satins, and that she is
having fine dresses made of those fabrics, foretells poverty and want:
if she imagines that she is presented with a plain cheap dress, and is
pleased with the present, it is a sign she will have some excellent
luck; but if she dislikes it, it shows that she will refuse an offer that
will cause her after regrets. 8, 7, 56.</p>

<p><a id="SILVER"></a>SILVER. (<i>See <a href="#METALS">Metals</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="SINGING"></a>SINGING. To dream of singing solemn music in a choir, is a sign
of the death of a young girl who is your esteemed friend or relative:
to lovers, such a dream foretells the loss of sweethearts: if you imagine
you are singing some lively tune by yourself, it is a sign of sorrow,
though it may not be connected with any death. 34, 18.</p>

<p><a id="SINGLE"></a>SINGLE. If a married woman dreams that she is single, and that
attentions are being paid to her by a beau, it foretells that her husband
has become captivated by a new love, and will probably be
false to his vows: the omen is similar to a married man who dreams
that he is either a bachelor or widower. 69, 72.</p>

<p><a id="SISTER"></a>SISTER. (<i>See <a href="#BROTHERS">Brothers</a>.</i>) To dream you see your sister denotes a
speedy death in your family, and that the dreamer will be long-lived:
if you are in love, it is a favorable omen. 24, 8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p><a id="SKATING"></a>SKATING. To dream of skating over smooth ice, and gliding along
without much effort, is a sign of success and good luck: if you are
skating with ladies, it foretells that your love matters will go smoothly;
if the ice be broken or lumpy, it denotes difficulties; and if you
imagine you fall down, you will probably experience a misfortune or
have great trouble. 4, 7, 28.</p>

<p><a id="SKY"></a>SKY. A clear sky denotes a marriage, speedy, and happy; a red
sky, increase of wealth; if you ascend into the sky, you may look
for much honor; a cloudy sky shows misfortune. 2, 11, 24.</p>

<p>SLAUGHTER-HOUSE. To dream of being in an empty slaughter-house,
shows that you are in danger, but can avoid it by precaution.
To see animals slaughtered is a good sign, if the blood flow freely;
if the blood does not flow, you will meet with some accident. 26, 12.</p>

<p><a id="SLAVE"></a>SLAVE. To dream that a favorite slave has become ungrateful,
and run away, is a sign that some one has been tampering with him
or her, but without effect; if, in your dream, you imagine that one of
your favorite negroes has been impertinent or neglectful, and is to be
flogged, and that you feel bad about it, it shows that some one will try
to injure you through the medium of your slaves, and you should
therefore look sharp to the characters of white people around. 62, 4.</p>

<p>SLEIGH-RIDE. To dream of a sleigh-ride, where the sleighing is
good, and the sleigh glides free and noiseless, is an excellent omen,
as it foretells success and good fortune generally, particularly to farmers:
but if you imagine the sleighing is poor, and that the runners
screech on the ground, it foretells trouble and unhappiness. Young
men who dream of sleigh-riding with girls, stopping at taverns,
drinking, getting the girls boozy, and then performing unnamable
pranks, are thus forewarned that they will be poor and shiftless, as
such dreams are certain omens of misery and disgrace. 67, 46.</p>

<p><a id="SLIDING"></a>SLIDING. (<i>See <a href="#ICE">Ice</a>.</i>) To dream of sliding on smooth ice, foretells
good luck: if a girl dreams that a young man assists her in sliding,
and that she enjoys it, she will soon get an agreeable lover: ragged
or wet ice, or holes in the ice, foreshadow difficulties. If a girl
dreams of falling down on the ice, and that her lover falls with her,
and overtops her, they may as well go to the parson at once, and
have the knot tied, as it is a sure thing to happen. 4, 28.</p>

<p>SMALL-POX. (<i>See <a href="#SORES">Sores</a>.</i>) To dream that you have this disease,
foretells health and good fortune: if a lover should be so ungallant,
as to imagine that his sweetheart is thus afflicted, it is a sign that he
will marry a great beauty; if she happens to be a beauty, it will be
all right, of course; if not, he will look out for number two. 41, 32.</p>

<p><a id="SMOCK"></a>SMOCK. (<i>See <a href="#LINEN">Linen</a>.</i>) If a girl dreams that she has a ragged undergarment,
it foretells that some rich greenhorn will try to seduce
her, and failing, will offer her marriage: if she dreams that she has
a good supply of beautiful worked undergarments, it is a sign that
she will sigh in vain for a lover; if she imagines that a gentleman
gives her a new smock, she will be in danger of losing her chastity.
12.</p>

<p><a id="SMOKE"></a>SMOKE. To dream of being in a room full of smoke, foretells that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
you will engage in an angry controversy, and perhaps quarrel: lovers
who dream of smoke, will nose out the fire when they next meet,
and it will prove to be either one of anger or of lust. 76, 5.</p>

<p><a id="SNAKE"></a>SNAKE. To dream of snakes is a sign of an enemy, or that some
one is slandering you; it also denotes quarrels and angry disputes:
if an engaged young lady dreams of them, she had better ascertain
positively whether her lover is all right before she marries him.
47, 50.</p>

<p><a id="SNEEZE"></a>SNEEZE. To dream you sneeze, is a sign of long life. 55.</p>

<p><a id="SNOW"></a>SNOW. (<i>See Sleigh-Ride and Thaw.</i>) To dream that the ground is
covered with clean, white snow, is a sign of joy and pleasure: if you
walk in it, it foretells that you will go on a pleasant journey; to eat
it, denotes health: if the snow is dirty, or melted in patches, you
will have troubles, but they will not amount to much. To dream of
a regular storm, is a sign you will be very successful in all your love
and business affairs. 21, 67, 46.</p>

<p><a id="SNUFF"></a>SNUFF. (<i>See <a href="#TOBACCO">Tobacco</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="SNUFFERS"></a>SNUFFERS. (<i>See <a href="#CANDLES">Candles</a>.</i>) To dream of snuffing out a candle, is
a sign of a death in the family: if you imagine that you snuff it too
short, without putting it out, it foretells that you will do something
that will make a female friend shed tears. 40.</p>

<p><a id="SOAP"></a>SOAP. Signifies trouble in business, but it will soon depart. 66,
3, 11.</p>

<p>SOLDIER’S DRUM. (<i>See <a href="#ZOUAVE">Zouave</a>, <a href="#PARADE">Parade</a> and <a href="#PROCESSION">Procession</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="SORES"></a>SORES. To dream of your body being covered with blotches,
shows that a great fortune will fall to you. To have the arms full of
sores, shows ill success in business. 19, 74.</p>

<p><a id="SOW"></a>SOW. To dream of a sow with a large litter of pigs, denotes
abundance to a farmer, but is a sign of ill-health to a tradesman or
mechanic: if a girl dreams this, it foretells that she will soon marry
a man in bad health. 4, 12, 48.</p>

<p><a id="SPIDER"></a>SPIDER. To dream that you see a spider coming toward you, is a
sign that some one will soon pay you money: if you imagine that
the spider spins down before your face, the omen is similar, for you
will make a good lot of money in some way. If a married woman
dreams of seeing a large spider, it foretells that she will have a miscarriage,
which she will not be sorry for. 72, 16.</p>

<p>SPY-GLASS. To dream of looking through one of these instruments
and observing objects at a distance, is a sign that you will enlarge
your possessions; if you are a farmer, you will add to your
farm; if a man of business, enlarge your business, &amp;c.; but to a
poor devil who hasn’t got much of anything, it predicts that he will
increase his family for the want of something else to enlarge. 14.</p>

<p><a id="SQUINTING"></a>SQUINTING. (<i>See <a href="#EYE">Eye</a>.</i>) If a girl dreams of seeing a good-looking
young man who squints, it is a sign that some one has fallen in
love with her, and only waits an opportunity to demonstrate his passion:
if a gentleman dreams that his sweetheart squints, it foretells
that she is thinking about some one else rather than him, and would
not break her heart if he refused to  “come to tea.” 49.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p><a id="SQUIRREL"></a>SQUIRREL. To dream of these animals is a sign of good fortune;
they denote abundant crops to a farmer, and success to any
one: if a man dreams of being bitten by a squirrel, it foretells that
he will lose something by robbery; if he catches the animal when it
bites him, and puts it in a cage, the omen is different, for he will
have a piece of good luck—though a robbery may be mixed up in
it. 21.</p>

<p><a id="STABLE"></a>STABLE. To dream of a stable denotes hospitality and good entertainment.
2, 11.</p>

<p>STAGE-COACH. To dream of riding in one signifies good luck in
business: if you run after one, you will be out of employment for a
long season: to see one pass, will rid you of troublesome friends. If
you are in a stage-coach and it turns over without injuring you, you
will be lucky in your speculations; if you dream you are killed by
the fall, you must expect misfortune. (<i>See <a href="#RIDING">Riding</a> and <a href="#COACH">Coach</a>.</i>) 6,
12, 72.</p>

<p><a id="STAIN"></a>STAIN. For a girl to dream of stains on her dress, is a sign of
scandal: if she imagines that the stains are in front, she will be accused
of an improper intimacy with a gentleman; if on the right
sleeve, it will be insinuated that she took what did not belong to
her; if on the left sleeve, some one will be disparaging her veracity.
If a lover dreams that his sweetheart’s dress is stained behind, it
shows that she is untrue to him. 65, 13.</p>

<p><a id="STARS"></a>STARS. (<i>See <a href="#NIGHT">Night</a>.</i>) To dream of seeing multitudes of bright
stars in a clear sky, is a sign (to a lady) that she will have a great
many children, and troops of good friends: to a man of business,
such a dream denotes as many customers as he sees stars in a clear
sky. If a girl dreams of seeing stars, and notices one or more to be
brighter than the rest, those bright ones are lovers, and the small
ones are her children or friends. 4, 19.</p>

<p><a id="STATUE"></a>STATUE. To dream of marble statues is a sign of advancement;
those who imagine that they see beautiful statuary will be sure to
rise above their present position in society. 3, 13.</p>

<p><a id="STEALING"></a>STEALING. (<i>See <a href="#THIEF">Thief</a>.</i>) If you dream of being robbed, it is a
sign that you will make a good speculation of some kind; to dream
of stealing any particular article yourself, foretells that you will soon
want just that thing; thus, if you imagine that you steal money, you
will be badly in want of some. 49, 16.</p>

<p><a id="STEEL"></a>STEEL. (<i>See <a href="#METALS">Metals</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="STEEPLE"></a>STEEPLE. (<i>See <a href="#TOWER">Tower</a>.</i>) To dream of going up to the top of a
steeple, and looking off at a distance, is a sign that you will increase
your property or effects: if a girl dreams this, it foretells that she
will marry above her present position. 6.</p>

<p><a id="STICK"></a>STICK. To hold a stick foretells mourning; to use it as a prop, instability
of fortune; to any one with it shows that you are
charitable; to receive a beating with one, predicts you will better
your position in life. 7, 7[TN: illegible].</p>

<p><a id="STILLBORN"></a>STILLBORN. If a woman dreams that she gives birth to a stillborn
child, it foretells that her next child will be an uncommon bright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
one: a childless woman who dreams this, will realize her fondest
hopes. 49, 77.</p>

<p><a id="STING"></a>STING. To dream of being stung by a bee or wasp, foretells an
injury by unjust and scandalous reports: a young lady who dreams
that a bee stings her, will probably have her chastity questioned.
64, 18.</p>

<p><a id="STOCKINGS"></a>STOCKINGS. To dream of cotton-stockings, foretells moderate
happiness; of silk, poverty. To take them off, denotes the reception
of money. Stockings with holes in them, signify the loss of
property. 47, 71.</p>

<p><a id="STORM"></a>STORM. (<i>See <a href="#RAIN">Rain</a>, <a href="#HAIL">Hail</a> and <a href="#SNOW">Snow</a>.</i>) To dream of a devastating
storm, foretells losses and trouble: a violent rain-storm denotes that
you will have good luck, but that misfortunes will nevertheless injure
your prospects: gentle showers promise the luck without the adverse
omen. 21, 72.</p>

<p><a id="STOVE"></a>STOVE. To dream of a stove is a sign of wealth, if there be a fire
in it; but if cold, a sign of poverty. 8, 60.</p>

<p><a id="STRANGER"></a>STRANGER. For a girl to dream that she is kissed by a stranger,
promises her a new lover: a married woman who dreams this will
probably soon present her husband with a stranger in the shape of a
new baby, and he will unhappily doubt its paternity. 62, 8.</p>

<p><a id="STRAW"></a>STRAW. To dream of a bundle of straw denotes abundance; if
scattered about, poverty. 4, 51, 78.</p>

<p><a id="STRAWBERRIES"></a>STRAWBERRIES. To dream of this fruit, denotes success in love
affairs, and a happy marriage. 39, 78.</p>

<p><a id="SUCKLE"></a>SUCKLE. (<i>See Wet-Nurse.</i>) If a married woman dreams of suckling
a child, it foretells that she will soon give birth to another;
should a bachelor dream of seeing a child suckled, he had better
make up his mind that he will soon have a young lady’s board to
pay, whether he marries or not; but as the latter would be the better
course let him be looking round for a wife at once. A married
man who dreams this, will soon become a happy father. 7, 9, 63.</p>

<p><a id="SUGAR"></a>SUGAR. To dream of sugar denotes purity: if a lover dreams
that his sweetheart presents him with white loaf-sugar, it shows that
her affection for him is pure and disinterested; it is therefore a good
sign for him to dream of taking tea with her, as she would naturally
put such sugar in his tea: to dream of sugar of any kind, or sugar
candy, is an excellent omen. 19, 48.</p>

<p>An old prediction runs as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Dreams of sugar and sweetmeat,</div>
  <div class="verse">Or drinking wine with pleasure great,</div>
  <div class="verse">And all dreams pleasant in condition,</div>
  <div class="verse">Show sports of love, and love’s fruition.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="SUN"></a>SUN. To dream that the sun blinds you, foretells that you will be
overwhelmed with good fortune: to see a beautiful bright sun, is a
sign of success in anything you may undertake: a red sun denotes
mishaps and accidents: if the sun looks dim and smoky, it foreshadows
trouble and difficulties. To dream of seeing the sun rise
brings good news and luck; the setting sun, misfortune. 2, 10, 20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p><a id="SWALLOWS"></a>SWALLOWS. To dream of these birds, is a good omen, as it foretells
health and abundant crops to farmers: if you dream of killing a
swallow, it is a sign of a misfortune; if you catch the bird, you will
have splendid luck and get plenty of money; but if, after capturing,
you dream you let him go, a fortune will slip through your fingers.
25.</p>

<p><a id="SWAN"></a>SWAN. To dream of a white swan, signifies riches; a black one,
domestic sorrow. Its song denotes death. 9, 18.</p>

<p><a id="SWEARING"></a>SWEARING. (<i>See <a href="#BLASPHEMY">Blasphemy</a>.</i>) To dream that you hear violent
altercations and profane swearing, is a sign that you will lose caste,
and go down in the world: if a man dreams that in his anger he
curses and swears, it foretells that he will come to poverty. 72, 4.</p>

<p><a id="SWEEPING"></a>SWEEPING. For a girl to dream of sweeping the house, foretells
that a lover will soon make his appearance: if a married woman
dreams this, it shows that some outsider is charmed with her, and
may venture to make dishonorable proposals. 39, 12.</p>

<p><a id="SWIMMING"></a>SWIMMING. To dream of swimming is an excellent omen, as it
foretells success and good fortune generally: if you dream you are
swimming, or bathing in clear water with ladies, it predicts that you
will soon marry the one of your choice, particularly if she be present;
and to dream you are naked and swimming in clear water, is a sign
of excellent luck in business matters. 54, 18.</p>

<p><a id="SWORD"></a>SWORD. To dream of having a sword, is a sign of poverty: if you
dream of seeing a man flourish one of these weapons, it foretells you
will make a loss. A young girl who imagines her lover wears a
sword, had better give up all ideas of silks and satins, and learn how
to cook and wash, for she will be a poor man’s wife. 17.</p>

<p>TABLE-CLOTH. To dream of a dirty table-cloth foretells that you
will have plenty to eat. 51.</p>

<p><a id="TAILOR"></a>TAILOR. If a girl dreams that she has a tailor for her beau, and
is pleased with him, it is a sign that she will marry a softly sort of a
fellow, who will allow her to be both master and mistress after marriage.
Here is a popular rhyme in illustration: 19, 70.</p>

<p>
The maid who dreams a tailor she would wed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will marry one who’ll be a log in bed;</span><br />
And she’ll be master, too, of all his riches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, in the vulgar parlance,  “wear the breeches!”</span><br />
</p>

<p><a id="TALL"></a>TALL. If a young lady dreams that her beau is a very tall man, it
is a sign that her future husband will be a  “wee bit of a fellow,” and
not of much account. 4.</p>

<p><a id="TAMARINDS"></a>TAMARINDS. To dream of tamarinds shows much vexation and
uneasiness through a woman, bad success in trade, a rainy season,
and news from beyond sea that is disagreeable: in love they denote
disappointment. 77, 16.</p>

<p><a id="TANNERY"></a>TANNERY. To dream of being in a tannery is a sign of health
and riches: if a girl dreams that her beau is a tanner, she will probably
get a good husband, and one who is well off, and will live to a
good old age, for your tanners are usually tough customers. 52, 7.</p>

<p><a id="TAR"></a>TAR. To dream of tar is a sign you will travel by water: if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
dream you get it on your hands or clothes, it shows that you will
have difficulties; and to imagine you accidentally seat yourself on
tar, and get stuck to the seat, foretells that you will be detained
against your will in some foreign country. 12, 6, 72.</p>

<p><a id="TAVERN"></a>TAVERN. (<i>See <a href="#INN">Inn</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="TEA"></a>TEA. To dream of drinking tea, or being present at a tea-party, is
a sign of thrift and domestic happiness: a girl who dreams of meeting
her lover at such a party, or of drinking tea with him, may be
sure that he’s all right, and she can close her matrimonial bargain
with him at once without any risk. 61, 19.</p>

<p><a id="TEARS"></a>TEARS. To dream of shedding tears of sympathy, is a sign that
some one is in love with you; this applies to both sexes, but more
particularly to girls who cry easy: if you imagine you cry from grief,
some good fortune awaits you, and you will have riches in proportion
to the tears shed: if you dream that you shed tears from vexation,
it shows that you will experience a loss just in proportion to the tears,
or that some one will injure your prospects by circulating a scandal. 14.</p>

<p><a id="TEETH"></a>TEETH. To dream you lose your teeth, denotes the loss of friends,
troubles, and misfortunes; to the lover it shows the loss of your
sweetheart’s affections: to dream you cut a new tooth, denotes the
birth of a child who will make a figure in the world. 33, 11, 2.</p>

<p><a id="TELEGRAPH"></a>TELEGRAPH. To dream of one denotes tidings from abroad, in a
short space of time, and still more speedily if you think the telegraph
is at work. 47, 10, 78.</p>

<p><a id="TELESCOPE"></a>TELESCOPE. (<i>See Spy-Glass.</i>) To dream of looking through a
telescope at a distance over farm lands, is a sign you will either purchase
a farm or inherit one: if you dream of looking at the stars, it
shows that you will rise in the world—if at the moon, and you are
delighted with the view, it predicts for you great riches. 7, 14.</p>

<p><a id="TEMPEST"></a>TEMPEST. (<i>See <a href="#STORM">Storm</a>.</i>) To dream of long-continuing and great
tempests, signifies affliction, troubles, dangers, losses and perils; to
the poor, repose. 57, 8.</p>

<p>TEN-PINS. To dream of playing ten-pins, foretells disgrace; if the
centre pin falls, one of the players will die; if many pins fall, all of
the players will suffer loss. 10, 2, 20.</p>

<p><a id="THAW"></a>THAW. To dream of a thaw, and walking in splashy snow, foretells
trouble and losses: if a young fellow dreams that he walks
through splashy snow to go a courting, it is a sign that he will quarrel
with his sweetheart. 34, 18.</p>

<p><a id="THEATRE"></a>THEATRE. For a young man to dream of taking his sweetheart
to the theatre, is a sign that she will favor a new beau: if he dreams
of going to the theatre alone, and seeing his lady-love among the
audience, it shows that she has already seen and spoken to a gentleman
that she likes better than him: if a lady dreams this of her beau,
the omen is similar. 2, 4, 8.</p>

<p><a id="THIEF"></a>THIEF. (<i>See <a href="#STEALING">Stealing</a>.</i>) To dream that thieves break into your
house and rob you, is a sign of honor or profit—the greater the robbery,
the more extensive will be your good fortune: if you dream
that you catch a thief and deliver him over to the officers of justice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
it denotes that you will have trouble in connection with your good
fortune. 49, 16, 3.</p>

<p><a id="THIRST"></a>THIRST. If any one dream of thirst or of drinking water, if the
water appear clear and acceptable, he will live joyfully and become
wealthy; if the water be troubled, warm, or offensive, it forewarns
him that without prudence, he will end his days in affliction. 20, 49.</p>

<p><a id="THORN"></a>THORN. For a girl to dream of accidentally sticking a thorn into
her finger is a sign she will have a ring presented to her, probably a
wedding ring: if a married woman dreams this, some outsider will
make love to her by first offering a ring. If any one dreams of sticking
a thorn in either foot or leg, it foretells improper intimacy with
the opposite sex which will not end in disgrace, but in marriage:
married people who dream this will do the same thing and not be
found out. 39.</p>

<p><a id="THROAT"></a>THROAT. For a married woman to dream that her throat is sore,
or swelled, or out of order, is a sign she is in the family way; and a
girl who dreams this had better be careful and keep pretty clear of
the young fellows, for fear of accidents. 60, 18.</p>

<p><a id="THUMB"></a>THUMB. If a girl dreams that her beau hurts her by pinching her
thumb, it is a sign that if she marries him she will have to get her
own living, and help to support him besides: for a man to dream of
losing his thumb, or of an injury to it, foretells poverty—on the contrary,
to dream of a big thumb denotes much wealth. 36, 5.</p>

<p><a id="THUNDER"></a>THUNDER. To dream of heavy thunder denotes large crops to
farmers: to tradesmen, mechanics, or speculators, it foretells a big
business, or a successful speculation: if you are terrified by thunder,
so much the better. 51.</p>

<p><a id="TIGER"></a>TIGER. To dream of seeing one of these animals in a rage, is a
sign that you have a treacherous friend who will endanger your reputation:
to see, in your dream, a sleeping or quiet tiger, foretells that
you will soon make the acquaintance of a treacherous or unworthy
person. If a girl dreams this, she had better be suspicious of the
next young man who offers her his attentions. 59, 62.</p>

<p><a id="TOAD"></a>TOAD. To dream of seeing a toad is a sign of a rain storm: if, in
your dream, you see multitudes of small toads, it foretells good crops
to farmers, and excellent luck to anybody: if a newly married woman
dreams this, it shadows forth that she will have as many smart children
as she sees toads—three or four at a time, perhaps—and if she
don’t, her husband will beget them elsewhere. 3.</p>

<p><a id="TOBACCO"></a>TOBACCO. For a boy to dream of chewing tobacco, is a sign of
poverty, as rum and tobacco-chewing go together: to dream of smoking
foretells waste, but is not exactly an omen of poverty, though
waste always precedes that state. The best way is not to dream of
using tobacco at all. If you dream of seeing large piles of tobacco,
it is a sign of bad luck and loss in some speculation. To dream you
take snuff is a bad omen in love affairs, but if you dream you sneeze
when you take it, it is a sign of long life. 49, 7, 55.</p>

<p><a id="TOMATOES"></a>TOMATOES. To dream of this valuable vegetable, denotes prosperity
in life; if you have children, they will thrive; if you are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
love, your suit will be successful. If a maiden dreams of them, it
denotes that she will marry her present sweetheart, have many children,
and be very happy; to a farmer it denotes abundant crops.
78, 6.</p>

<p><a id="TOMB"></a>TOMB. To dream of visiting a large and magnificent tomb-stone
foreshadows that you will fall in love with some one above you in
social position: visiting a cemetery or grave-yard in your dream, is a
sign that your turn will soon come to join the matrimonial ranks. 48.</p>

<p><a id="TONGUE"></a>TONGUE. If a lady dreams of having a sore on her tongue, it is
a sign that she has uttered a slander. 54.</p>

<p>TOOTH-ACHE. To dream that you have the tooth-ache is a sign
of trouble: if you imagine that you are about to have the tooth pulled,
it foretells that your trouble will end by a piece of good luck; and if
you dream that the tooth is out, and you have it in your hand, you
will soon gain a good lump of money. 8, 5, 34.</p>

<p><a id="TORCH"></a>TORCH. To see a bright torch-light at a distance in a dark night,
and go toward it, foretells a successful journey; but if you stumble
by the way you will experience an accident: to dream of carrying a
lighted torch at night, is a sign that some distant friend will pay you
a visit. 20.</p>

<p><a id="TOWER"></a>TOWER. (<i>See <a href="#STEEPLE">Steeple</a>.</i>) To dream of going upon a high tower, and
looking off on a beautiful landscape, foretells that you will acquire
land either by purchase or inheritance: if you look off upon the
water, it is a sign of a journey by sea, during which you will acquire
riches: if birds are flying around the tower, they foretell so many
troubles. 58.</p>

<p><a id="TRAP"></a>TRAP. To dream of setting a trap to catch rats or mice, is a sign,
to a girl, that she will receive the attentions of a dishonest lover: if
she dreams of catching any, she will probably marry a great scamp,
or be seduced by one. 6.</p>

<p><a id="TRAVELING"></a>TRAVELING. To dream of traveling by railroad or steamboat is
a very good omen, as it denotes thrift and success in your business;
but if you dream you are journeying in your own private coach, it
foreshadows poverty in the end, though you may have temporary
good luck: if you dream you have crossed the ocean, and find yourself
in a foreign country, you may be sure that good fortune will attend
all your business transactions. 6, 11, 66.</p>

<p><a id="TREES"></a>TREES. (<i>See <a href="#BLOSSOMS">Blossom</a>.</i>) To dream of green and flourishing trees is
an excellent omen, as it foretells riches—the larger the trees, the better
the fortune: if you dream of climbing into a high tree, you will
not only be rich, but will come to great distinction. If a girl should
dream of seeing her lover up a tree, she will marry a wealthy and
distinguished man. 4.</p>

<p><a id="TRIPE"></a>TRIPE. If a woman dreams of cleaning tripe, it foretells that she
will either be untrue to her husband or an outrage will be perpetrated
upon her: to dream of eating tripe is about as bad, for it shows to a
man that he will be engaged in some affair with a female (not his
wife) which will bring him to disgrace. 28, 9.</p>

<p><a id="TRIPLETS"></a>TRIPLETS. If a woman dreams that she gives birth to three chil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>dren
at one parturition, it foretells riches and honors: if a husband
dreams that his wife is so delivered, the omen is the same: if any
one dreams of seeing triplets who are healthy and well-formed, it
foretells good luck and success, particularly in love matters. 46, 5.</p>

<p><a id="TROUT"></a>TROUT. To dream of catching trout is an excellent omen, as it
foretells that you will get money—the larger the trout, the more cash
you will receive. It is stated in some of the books that to newly
married people such a dream foretells the birth of a child, but I have
been unable to verify this, because most young married people will
have children whether they dream of trout or not. 29, 5.</p>

<p><a id="TRUMPET"></a>TRUMPET. To dream you hear the sound of a trumpet, is a bad
omen, and denotes trouble and misfortune; to the tradesman it presages
the loss of business; to the farmer, bad crops; to the lover, insincerity
in the object of your affections. 46, 9.</p>

<p><a id="TRUNK"></a>TRUNK. To dream of a full trunk, shows the necessity of economy;
an empty one, signifies that you may expect to receive money.
39, 62, 1.</p>

<p><a id="TUB"></a>TUB. To dream of a tub is a bad omen: if it be filled with water,
you have evil to fear; an empty tub signifies trouble; and to run
against one, sorrow. 46, 9.</p>

<p><a id="TULIPS"></a>TULIPS. To dream of these beautiful flowers is a sign of abundance:
if you imagine you see a garden full of them belonging to
yourself, it foretells that you will become rich and distinguished: if
a girl dreams that her lover presents her with tulips, she will undoubtedly
marry well, and probably her husband will be wealthy. 48.</p>

<p><a id="TURKEY"></a>TURKEY. To dream of seeing a flock of turkeys denotes to a
tradesman, or a farmer, that he will have a transaction which will
bring him in a considerable sum in ready money: if a lover who is
about to be married dreams of turkeys, he will find that his sweetheart
has got a marriage portion in ready money. 72, 15.</p>

<p><a id="TURNIP"></a>TURNIP. To dream of turnips signifies the discovery of secrets
and domestic quarrels. 29, 52.</p>

<p><a id="TURTLE"></a>TURTLE. To dream of turtles is a sign of long life: an engaged
young lady who dreams of these animals will probably marry according
to her wishes, and live with her husband until they become an
old couple; but her husband will be one of the slow and easy kind.
67, 49, 5.</p>

<p><a id="TWINS"></a>TWINS. To dream of having twins, brings good news, and is a
sign of honor or riches; it is also a good omen in love matters if a
man dreams it, but if a girl has this dream she must look out for the
boys. 44, 4.</p>

<p><a id="UMBRELLA"></a>UMBRELLA. If a young girl dreams that she has got a new umbrella,
it foretells a new lover: if a married woman dreams this, it is
a sign that some other gentleman besides her husband is enamored
of her. A man who dreams of buying an umbrella will have a narrow
escape from threatened danger. 70, 30, 1.</p>

<p><a id="UNDER"></a>UNDER GROUND. To dream that you go down under ground,
whether into a well, a deep cellar or vault, or a cave, denotes your
early death; but if you dream that you are digging in the ground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
and are in a hole which you have dug, the omen is different, for it
denotes riches and long life. 5, 9, 45.</p>

<p><a id="UNDRESS"></a>UNDRESS. To see your wife undress, signifies wantonness; to
undress in the presence of others, slander; to undress in your room
alone, the discovery of secrets. 48, 3.</p>

<p><a id="VACCINATED"></a>VACCINATED. To dream of being vaccinated foretells good
health; and if you imagine that you have a large sore on your arm
from vaccination, it is a sign that you will present to some one a liberal
gift, and receive much honor. 49.</p>

<p><a id="VARNISHING"></a>VARNISHING. To dream that your house or furniture is being,
or has been, newly varnished, is a sign of a funeral; but if you imagine
that you are varnishing anything, it merely foretells a loss with
out a death. 59, 76.</p>

<p><a id="VAULT"></a>VAULT. An unexpected estate will fall to you, if you dream of a
vault. 21, 18.</p>

<p><a id="VEAL"></a>VEAL. To dream of veal being roasted is good; but boiled, shows
sickness; and raw, a great disappointment; particularly to those who
have recently formed an attachment or any new connection. 48, 2.</p>

<p><a id="VELVET"></a>VELVET. If a lady dreams of new velvet dresses, it foretells poverty:
velvet cushions, slippers or bonnets, are signs of waste and
want. 36, 18.</p>

<p><a id="VENISON"></a>VENISON. To dream of eating venison is a sign that you will
travel: if you imagine you see large saddles of venison in market, it
foretells a journey for business purposes which will be profitable.
42, 70.</p>

<p><a id="VERMIN"></a>VERMIN. To dream of any kind of vermin, is ominous of ill-luck
and enemies, especially if they are in the house, or near the fireplace;
but if out of the house, they are unimportant. 27, 62.</p>

<p><a id="VEXATION"></a>VEXATION. To dream of being much vexed, foretells the reverse,
and that you will shortly be much pleased. 33, 61.</p>

<p><a id="VINEGAR"></a>VINEGAR. To dream you drink vinegar, signifies sickness and
sharp words: to use it in pickling, is a sign of gain. 29, 6, 76.</p>

<p><a id="VINES"></a>VINES. To dream of seeing or pruning grape-vines, or gathering
grapes, is prosperity to persons in trade, journeys to the rich, employment
to the poor, and comfort to those in affliction. 38, 17.</p>

<p><a id="VIOLIN"></a>VIOLIN. (<i>See <a href="#FIDDLE">Fiddle</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="VIRGIN"></a>VIRGIN. If a man dreams that he defloured a virgin, it is a sign
that he will be disgraced by some act of his own: to dream of seeing
the Virgin Mary, foretells that great honors await you: such a
dream, to an honest business man, promises him riches and honor;
but to a dishonest one, it foretells disaster. 54, 3.</p>

<p><a id="VOMITING"></a>VOMITING. To dream of vomiting is usually a sign of health: if
you imagine that you vomit up worms, it foretells that you will have
good luck in preventing a loss, or a robbery. 14, 65.</p>

<p><a id="VOTE"></a>VOTE. To dream you are voting, is bad, particularly to a sick
person: for a newly married woman to dream of voting, is a sure
sign that her first child will be a boy, who will come to great honors. 9.</p>

<p><a id="VOW"></a>VOW. To dream that you have made a vow and broken it, is bad
to all. 21, 78.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p><a id="VULTURE"></a>VULTURE. To dream of the vulture is unfortunate to all, except
sick persons, to whom it foretells a speedy recovery. 41, 62.</p>

<p><a id="WADING"></a>WADING. If a girl dreams of wading in clear water, it is a sign
that she will soon marry, and be delighted with her husband’s embraces:
if she imagines that the water is rily or muddy, it foretells
that she will enjoy the pleasures of illicit love. If a man dreams of
wading, it denotes that he will be engaged in some intrigue with a
female—the deeper the water, the more difficult the realization of his
wishes: muddy water denotes loose women. 20, 16.</p>

<p><a id="WAKE"></a>WAKE. To dream of going to a wake where drinking and howling
is going on, is a sign of poverty and misery: if a girl dreams
this, it foretells her speedy marriage with a man who will turn out
to be a miserable drunkard. If a young man dreams of seeing his
sweetheart at a wake, he had better back out from the bargain, as
she will never be of much account, and may become a drunkard. 8.</p>

<p><a id="WALKING"></a>WALKING. To dream you are walking in a dirty and muddy
place, foretells sickness and vexation: in love, it denotes bad temper
and disappointment. 47.</p>

<p><a id="WALLS"></a>WALLS. To dream you are walking on, or climbing over walls,
denotes some dangerous enterprise, trouble, and vexation: if you get
down without the wall falling, or hurting yourself, you will succeed;
if not, be disappointed. 71, 4.</p>

<p><a id="WALNUTS"></a>WALNUTS. To dream of them denotes riches and happiness; to
the lover, success and a good tempered sweetheart. 37, 16.</p>

<p><a id="WAR"></a>WAR. To dream that war exists, and that you see bodies of troops
marching, foretells quarrels and troubles in your family, if you have
one, and if not, among your relatives: if you imagine you see a battle,
the omen is still worse, as the quarrel will probably become public
and notorious. 4, 6, 24.</p>

<p>WARMING-PAN. If any single person dreams that his or her
bed is warmed with one of these utensils, it is a positive forerunner
of their marriage: if a married woman dreams this, it is a sign that
she will go to bed with a strange bedfellow (whether male or female,
is not known). 16.</p>

<p><a id="WARTS"></a>WARTS. To dream of warts on your left hand is a sign you will
receive some money; if they are on the right hand, it foretells that
you will pay away money: to dream of a wart on the nose, signifies
that you will be distinguished; on the neck or bosom of a female, denotes
riches. 65.</p>

<p><a id="WASHING"></a>WASHING. To dream of washing, foretells change of abode, and
if you wash in clear, cold water, the dream is an omen of good; but
If the water is dirty or turbid, it is the reverse. If a woman dream
she is washing clothes, it is a sign she will hear good news within
twenty-four hours. 20, 16.</p>

<p><a id="WASP"></a>WASP. (<i>See <a href="#STING">Sting</a>.</i>) To dream of wasps denotes thrift and abundance,
particularly to farmers and those who have fruit-trees. If a
girl dreams that she is stung by a mud-wasp, it foretells that she will
marry a gentleman who will love her dearly. 62, 18.</p>

<p><a id="WASTE"></a>WASTE. To dream of waste is a sign of beggary, provided you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
are the cause of the waste; but if you feel bad and try to prevent
it, the omen is one of losses, which may not end in beggary. 29, 17.</p>

<p><a id="WATCH"></a>WATCH. (<i>See <a href="#CLOCK">Clock</a>.</i>) If you dream of buying a gold watch, it is
a sign of poverty; but if you imagine that you are presented with
one, it foretells good luck and money-getting: to dream of losing
your gold watch is also a good omen, as it denotes success in business.
42, 11.</p>

<p><a id="WATCHMAN"></a>WATCHMAN. To dream of calling in one, gives confidence: to
see a person taken to prison by a watchman, shows that you must
be careful in conducting your business. If the watchman take hold
of you, it is a very good sign. To see many watchmen together,
signifies the loss of money. 67, 52.</p>

<p><a id="WATER"></a>WATER. To dream of being on the water, is good, if the water
be clear; but if muddy or troubled, the reverse. To see a wide expanse
of water, over or on which you wish to get, but cannot, shows
that you are about to embark in some undertaking without first securing
the means of success. (<i>See Bathing, Fountain, Pump, Pitcher,
River, Rowing, Sailing, Swimming, Thirst, Washing and Well.</i>)
42, 18.</p>

<p><a id="WATERMELONS"></a>WATERMELONS. (<i>See <a href="#MELONS">Melons</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="WEDDING"></a>WEDDING. (<i>See <a href="#MARRIAGE">Marriage</a>.</i>) To dream of being at a jolly wedding,
is a sign of a funeral: if you imagine that you kiss the bride,
it foretells the death of a dear friend or relative. In an old dream-book,
published 1808, it is stated that to dream of kissing the bride,
is a sign of your own death, but on referring to the best authorities,
I find it is necessary to dream that the bride should herself be the
kissing party, and that an impressive kiss from her on the occasion
denotes the death of the person kissed. 42, 78, 2.</p>

<p><a id="WELL"></a>WELL. To dream of looking into a deep well, is a sign you will
find a treasure: if you dream of falling into a deep well, it foretells
your death: if you imagine you draw clear water from a well, and
drink it, you will surely have good fortune of some kind. 7, 14, 77.</p>

<p>WET-NURSE. To dream of seeing a wet-nurse suckling a child,
is a sign of venery: to a married man it foretells that he will break
his marriage vows; and to unmarried girls it denotes shame. 7,
9, 63.</p>

<p><a id="WHALE"></a>WHALE. To dream of seeing one of these monsters alive in the
ocean, is a sign that you will be in great peril of losing either your
life or property: if you dream that you spear or harpoon a whale
successfully, it foretells great and abundant fortune. 37, 22, 61.</p>

<p><a id="WHEAT"></a>WHEAT. (<i>See <a href="#GRAIN">Grain</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="WHISKERS"></a>WHISKERS. If a man dreams that he has very long whiskers or
beard, it foretells that he will commit some folly in connection with
a female; to a married man it shows that he will appear ridiculous
from neglect of his wife and attentions to other women who flatter
him; to a single man, that he will lose caste by foolish, though perhaps
not criminal conduct toward silly girls. 78.</p>

<p><a id="WHIST"></a>WHIST. (<i>See <a href="#CARDS">Cards</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="WHITEWASH"></a>WHITEWASH. To dream of having your house or place of busi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>ness
whitewashed, is an excellent omen, as it promises you good
health, and a good name and repute among your friends: if a woman
dreams of whitewashing her house, or any part of it, it foretells that
she will have a son who will be distinguished, or that some act of
hers will attract public attention. 42, 77.</p>

<p><a id="WHORE"></a>WHORE. If a man dreams of associating with one of this class of
women, it foretells losses and disgrace: should a girl dream of playing
the whore, when in fact she is chaste, it foretells her speedy marriage,
and that she will love her husband. 19.</p>

<p><a id="WHORTLEBERRIES"></a>WHORTLEBERRIES. For a girl to dream of picking these berries
in abundance, is a sign she will marry very young and get a
good husband, though not a rich one: to dream of eating whortleberries,
denotes health. 69, 30.</p>

<p><a id="WIDOW"></a>WIDOW. If a girl dreams that she is a widow, it foretells that
she will have many lovers: such a dream to a married woman, denotes
that some man beside her husband is in love with her. 38, 60.</p>

<p><a id="WIG"></a>WIG. To dream of wearing a wig is a good omen to a bald bachelor,
as it foretells that some lady has a design to catch the poor fellow,
and will not scruple as to the means she uses to accomplish it:
if a young man dreams of wearing a wig, it is a sign that he will
sleep with his sweetheart before he marries her. 3, 6, 69.</p>

<p><a id="WILL"></a>WILL. To dream of making your will is a sign of long life, and
good fortune generally: if you imagine that you make your will to
give a legacy to a lady, it foretells to a man (whether married or single)
that he will marry. 22.</p>

<p><a id="WILLOW"></a>WILLOW. To dream of weeping willows is a sign of sickness
and death: if they hang over a stream, it foretells sickness only.
12, 70.</p>

<p><a id="WINE"></a>WINE. To dream of drinking wine is a sign of poverty: if a
lover dreams that his sweetheart treats him to a glass of wine, it
foretells that she will be an unthrifty wife. 39.</p>

<p><a id="WITCH"></a>WITCH. To dream of a witch foretells that you will leave your
home and sojourn among strangers: if the witch attempts to injure
you, it denotes that you will be dependent upon strangers for your
support. No intelligent person believes in witches, yet a great many
dream of them, and the above is the horoscope of such a dream. 17.</p>

<p><a id="WOLF"></a>WOLF. To dream of being chased by one of these animals, foretells
that you will be cheated in a trade or bargain: if a girl dreams
of being frightened by a wolf, it shows that her lover (if she has
one) is a bad man, and she had better discard him; if she has no
lover, some black-hearted fellow will try to make her acquaintance. 45.</p>

<p><a id="WOODCHUCK"></a>WOODCHUCK. To dream of catching one of these animals, is a
sign that you will be robbed, and that the thief will be detected: if
you imagine you kill the woodchuck, you will probably recover your
stolen property. 36, 19.</p>

<p><a id="WOODS"></a>WOODS. (<i>See <a href="#GROVE">Grove</a> and <a href="#PICNIC">Picnic</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="WORK"></a>WORK. (<i>See <a href="#HARVEST">Harvest</a>.</i>) To dream that you were working hard, and
are very tired, is a sign of sickness: if you imagine that you see
men at work, it foretells a successful business. 77.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p><a id="WORMS"></a>WORMS. (<i>See <a href="#GRUB">Grub</a>.</i>) To dream of fish-worms, such as are dug in
the garden, is a sign of health and good fortune; dreaming of any
destructive worms foretells sickness and losses: if you dream that
worms spin down from a tree and light upon you, it denotes difficulties
and bad luck. 65, 4, 70.</p>

<p><a id="WOUND"></a>WOUND. To dream that you are wounded by being stabbed or
shot by an enemy, foretells losses and poverty; if the wounds are
accidental, it still denotes losses, though your general fortune may
not be affected. 13, 42.</p>

<p><a id="WREN"></a>WREN. To dream that one of these musical little birds makes her
nest anywhere on your premises, is a sign of joy and riches; a girl
who dreams this will make a happy match, though perhaps not a
rich one, as the riches only come to the family that lives in the
house. 1, 73.</p>

<p><a id="WRINKLES"></a>WRINKLES. If a lady dreams that her face has become wrinkled,
it is a sign that some one is, or has been, praising her good looks; an
old bachelor who dreams this,  “had better believe” that some young
lady is in love with him, for there is no accounting for taste. 66, 4.</p>

<p><a id="WRIST"></a>WRIST. If a girl dreams that her wrist is large or mis-shapen, it
foretells that she will come to poverty after marriage; if she imagines
that there is a tumor or swelling, or even a wart on it, it is a sign
that she will be dependent on some one for her bread, and that person
may or may not be her husband. 7, 57, 19.</p>

<p><a id="WRITING"></a>WRITING. (<i>See <a href="#PENS">Pen</a> and <a href="#ACCOUNTS">Accounts</a>.</i>) To dream of writing a letter,
foretells that absent friends are about to visit you: if a girl dreams
of writing a love-letter, it is a sign that her lover will soon return
and clasp her in his arms, if she allows any such familiarities. To
dream you make a blot while writing, is a sign of sickness. 14.</p>

<p><a id="YACHT"></a>YACHT. To dream you see a yacht under full sail, while you are
on shore, is a sign you will soon fall in love with a pretty maid, or
widow. To dream you are sailing in a yacht with a pleasant breeze,
is a good omen, and denotes success in business, and to lovers, happiness.
Dreams of sailing on smooth water are good to all persons,
but to dream the weather is stormy, predicts quarrels and strife. (<i>See
Ship and Boat.</i>) 71, 29.</p>

<p><a id="YELLOW"></a>YELLOW. To dream of having any yellow article presented to
you, is a sign you will get gold: if a girl dreams that her lover gives
her yellow flowers, it foretells that she will marry rich. 60, 41.</p>

<p><a id="YOKE"></a>YOKE. To dream of seeing sleek and healthy cattle yoked together
and acting in harmony, is a sign of a happy marriage: if a girl dreams
this, she will be apt to put her own neck in Hymen’s yoke before a
great while. To imagine you see yoked cattle wrangling, and trying
to get their necks out of the yoke, foretells matrimonial troubles,
though it still denotes wedlock to the unmarried. 6, 11.</p>

<p><a id="YOUNG"></a>YOUNG. If an old or middle aged person dreams that they are
young, it foretells their death: for a young person to dream that he
or she is a child, the omen is similar; but to dream <i>of youths</i>, is a sign
that you will live to a great age. 69, 4.</p>

<p><a id="ZEBRA"></a>ZEBRA. To dream of seeing a zebra, is a sign of a quarrel: if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
imagine that somebody presented you with one of these animals, or
that you have purchased it, it foretells, to a young man, that he will
marry a rich but quarrelsome wife, and that she will be constantly
annoying him by bragging of her property. 39, 70, 32.</p>

<p><a id="ZOUAVE"></a>ZOUAVE. (<i>See <a href="#PARADE">Parade</a>.</i>) To dream you see Zouaves, as well as
other soldiers and armed men, denotes, that you will have quarrels
and trouble in your family, if you have one, and if you have not,
among your relatives: to the single man, this dream foreshadows
that his sweetheart loves another better than himself; and to the
maiden it signifies her lover will try and seduce her. 58, 1, 77.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_FIND_LUCKY_NUMBERS_WITH" id="HOW_TO_FIND_LUCKY_NUMBERS_WITH">HOW TO FIND LUCKY NUMBERS WITH
DICE.</a></h2>


<p>This plan of ascertaining lucky numbers has always been exceedingly
popular with those persons who try their fortune at the lottery.
The manner of calculating a lucky number is as follows: Take two
dice, and after shaking them well in a box, throw them out, being
careful to note the whole number of spots on the uppermost sides of
the dice, then repeat this operation and again mark down the number
of spots as before. Having done this, you then consult the annexed
table and find the number of your first throw, then follow the
line down until you arrive at the number corresponding with your
second throw on the opposite side of the table. For example, we
will suppose you throw the first time, and the number of spots is
equal to 4. You must then look at the top of the line and find the
Roman numeral IV. You throw the second time and get 7 spots;
this you will find on the outside column, at the left hand, marked
VII. Then all you have to do is to place your finger on the IV. at
the top of the table and follow the line down until you arrive at VII.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
on the opposite side of the table, thus you will find the number 43,
which is the lucky number. Should you come to a cypher (0) you
must throw again. By following these simple directions you can get
as many good numbers as you wish to play.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_SHIFT_CHARM"></a>THE SHIFT CHARM.</h2>

<p>On going to bed, take off your under garment and turn it wrong
side outwards; hang it on the back of a chair, having first placed
the chair facing and in front of the bed. While doing this, repeat the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Husband approach! and without fear</div>
  <div class="verse">Sit on this chair, and thus be near</div>
  <div class="verse">The girl your heart doth hold most dear</div>
  <div class="verse">And if thy love is all sincere,</div>
  <div class="verse">To her, this night appear! appear!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>You must then get into bed backwards, and sleep in your night-gown
without any shift. You will probably dream of seeing an agreeable
young man, in which case your marriage within that year is certain.
If you do not dream of a man, you will never marry. You should be
alone in trying this charm, for if you speak to any one, or any one in
the room speaks, it breaks it at once.</p>

<h2><a name="FORTUNE-TELLING_WITH_A_PACK_OF" id="FORTUNE-TELLING_WITH_A_PACK_OF">FORTUNE-TELLING WITH A PACK OF
EUCHRE CARDS.</a></h2>


<p>Take a pack of thirty two cards, such as is used for the game of
Euchre. Each one of these cards has its own <i>particular</i> signification.
But when taken in connection with other cards its signification is
termed <i>conditional</i>.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>PARTICULAR SIGNIFICATION OF THE CARDS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="vl">♠</span> (<span class="smcap">Spades.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight</span>: A Surprise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nine</span>: Betrothal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten</span>: A Wedding.</p>

<p>In explaining the cards, my dear readers, to any one, shuffle the
pack three times, and let the person who wishes to know his fortune
cut it three times in succession. Then take up the cards, and let the
person in question draw one. This drawn card you place first upon
the table. Then spread out the pack in four rows, each containing
eight cards. (<i>See Engraving.</i>)</p>

<p>The first card is of the highest significance. In the first place it
indicates the character of the person inquiring, and according to the
following rule:</p>

<p><span class="vl">♠</span> Choleric, passionate, violent.</p>

<p><span class="vl">♣</span>  Sanguine, cheerful, mirthful, witty.</p>

<p><span class="vl">♦</span>  Phlegmatic, practical, unexcitable.</p>

<p><span class="vl">♥</span>  Melancholic, sentimental, poetical, talented.</p>

<p>As, however, the human character is never without more than one
of the above named characteristics, the first card signifies the most
prominent one, and the cards which lie on the right side and below
it are reckoned with it, by which the meaning of the first card is
either modified or corroborated.</p>

<p>If the person in question is a lady, and she has, for example, drawn
a club, the queen of clubs is herself, the knave of clubs is her intended,
the king her father, or uncle, as the case may be. The picture cards
of the other black suit are her friends and relations. It is the same
if she has drawn hearts or diamonds, only that in this case the picture
cards of the other red suit signify her friends and relations. If
the person inquiring is a gentleman, it is the same, except that he is
the knave of the suit which he has drawn, and his intended the queen.</p>

<p>From this first card, also, you form a judgment of one’s whole future
course in life. If its signification is joyful, the person’s life will be a
happy one. If, for example, it is the ace of hearts, it indicates that
the person will never be without a home, a dear and pleasant home
to him; if it is the ace of clubs, he will pass through life enjoying
honor and fame; if it is the ten of hearts with a female figure on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
either side, it signifies two wives; if with a male figure on either
side, and the person inquiring is a female, two husbands.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_096.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Example of Fortune-Telling with an Euchre Pack of Cards.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus much as to general rules. We will now instruct the reader
how to explain the cards in detail. We will suppose that it is a lady
who inquires of the cards, and endeavor, by means of an example, to
give an accurate explanation of the method to be pursued. Spread
out the cards before you, and observe carefully the different cards
while you read the fortune I shall predict from them. (<i>See Engraving,
page 96.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ace of Hearts.</span>—The young lady’s character, it seems, is sentimental,
melancholic, poetical, which three qualities are found more or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
less together. If the next card were a heart, it would indicate a temperament
inclined to love. As, however, the adjacent cards are clubs
and spades, of which two indeed are clubs, we conclude that the lady
often displays a cheerful, sanguine disposition, yet can, at times, be
very passionate. The main feature of her character, however, is the
melancholic.</p>

<p>We will now look around for the lady herself—she is found to be
the seventh card on the last row. Her lover, on the other hand, is
the eighth card in the second row. As he precedes her, this signifies
that she is already acquainted with him, and they seem already to
love one another, as a love card lies at his side, and also one at hers;
no card, however, lies between them to connect them, except the
queen of diamonds. This, however, is not altogether favorable, for a
queen between a loving pair signifies a rival (for a gentleman, the
knave signifies the same), and can as well indicate a separation as a
union, notwithstanding its similarity of color. The general rule is as
follows:—If the card which connects the queen and knave is of the
same color with them, it indicates a future union between the persons.
(Hearts and diamonds form one color, as do clubs and spades.)</p>

<p>One thing more: from the cards which lie next to the knave, we are
enabled to judge of the character and occupation of the lady’s intended.
In the present case, the cards next to the knave of hearts are
two spades, two diamonds, and one heart; his character, therefore, according
to the rules already given, is choleric, yet at times melancholic
and sentimental. In his daily conduct he is practical and considerate.</p>

<p>As to his occupation, the different colors have the following signification:</p>

<p><span class="vl">♠</span> A student, probably a clergyman.</p>

<p><span class="vl">♣</span> A lawyer—jurist.</p>

<p><span class="vl">♦</span> A mechanic, merchant, or a person who has chosen
for himself some practical career.</p>

<p><span class="vl">♥</span> A capitalist, a genius who devotes himself to some favorite
pursuit, also a military man.</p>

<p>The card at the right hand is commonly the decisive one, but as, in
the present case, there is no right hand card, the one at the left takes
its place; according to this, the lady’s intended is a capitalist, a
genius, or a military man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>We now proceed to tell the lady’s fortune in its particulars.</p>

<p>We commence from the ace of hearts, thus: a considerable windfall
will happen in your family, young lady. Either you or your parents
will draw a prize in the lottery, or heaven will drop some other
nice morsel into your mouth (ten of clubs).</p>

<p>This will give occasion to a journey, which you will take with an
acquaintance (king of spades and seven of diamonds). This journey
will be very agreeable to you, and especially will you enjoy yourself
at a ball, to which you will be invited by a friend of your travelling
companion (knave of clubs and eight of diamonds). You will then
dance a cotillion with a relative of your intended, perhaps with your
own brother-in-law that is to be (knave of diamonds).</p>

<p>When you return home, you will find a letter, at the sight of which
you will be disturbed, the hand-writing being that of a person unfriendly
to you (queen of spades, ace of spades). You open it, and
behold it is a proposal of marriage (nine of clubs), and from a relative
of the gentleman who invited you to the ball (king of clubs), which
touches the (nine of clubs).</p>

<p>As, however, you promise yourself nothing but vexation (eight of
spades) from this marriage, you refuse him (ten of spades), and it
will soon appear that a better fortune lies before you (eight of clubs).
Soon after, a wedding takes place (ten of hearts), namely, that of your
sister or friend (queen of diamonds), who, therefore, does not stand
between you and your intended to separate you, but to unite you.
The bridegroom is the gentleman who was your partner in the cotillion
at that ball (knave of diamonds). At this wedding you will
among others see your intended (knave of hearts), with whom you are
already acquainted. You will also meet there a gentleman, who,
when you last saw him, was dangerously ill (seven of spades, knave
of spades, and ten of diamonds). Your intended seizes the opportunity
to offer himself to you, and you become betrothed to him (nine
of hearts). You will receive a present from a relative or friend, perhaps
from your brother (ace of clubs, and king of diamonds).</p>

<p>Something now occurs to separate you from your betrothed (nine
of spades). It almost seems as if you were jealous of a lady whom
he formerly loved (queen of clubs, seven of hearts). A very tender
letter which he writes to you, from a bed of sickness upon which his
grief has prostrated him (ace of diamonds, nine of diamonds), soon reconciles
you again, and as not long after something occurs which
places him in a position to support a wife in comfort (seven of clubs),
the happy marriage is celebrated. Dear relatives (king of hearts,
king of diamonds, and queen of diamonds) prepare for you joyful
surprises, which combine to render this day an infinitely happy
one.</p>

<p>One thing more: if the ten of hearts is the last card in the last
row, the person in question will never marry; otherwise, each row
counts a year. You first count the rows until you come to the nine
of hearts (the betrothal), you then begin again and count to the ten
of hearts (the wedding), that is, in case the nine comes after the ten.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
If the nine comes before the ten, you continue to count without recommencing.</p>

<p>The young lady in question will therefore be betrothed in from two
to three years, and will be married in about two years after, for the
nine of hearts lies in the third row, and the ten in the second row.
She has then almost five years to enjoy her single life before she becomes
a wife.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3><a id="TO_FIND_OUT_WHOM_ONE_IS"></a>TO FIND OUT WHOM ONE IS TO HAVE FOR A HUSBAND.</h3>

<p>You select the four kings from a pack, and lay them side by side
in a row upon the table.</p>

<p>The lady who wishes to know her fortune gives to each of these
cards the name of some gentleman of her acquaintance who might be
likely to woo her in marriage. It is usual to pronounce these names
aloud before the company. The name given to the king of hearts is,
however, an exception. This secret the lady keeps to herself. To
these four kings, you can also add a queen, which then denotes the
old maid.</p>

<p>Now, take the rest of the pack, shuffle it thoroughly, let the person
in question cut three times and commence. Under each of the
above named picture cards you lay a card in turn, and as often as a
spade is placed under a spade, a heart under a heart, &amp;c., that is, as
often as a card of the same suit is placed under one of these picture
cards, the picture card is turned from its position.</p>

<p>The first time it takes a direction from left to right, the second
time it lies upside down, the third time it is raised again to a position
from right to left, and the fourth and last time it regains its former
upright position.</p>

<p>That one of the four kings, who, after these different changes, first
resumes his upright position, is to be the happy husband. If it should
happen to be the old maid, you can imagine what is in store for you.</p>

<p>After having learned from the cards who is to be the husband, the
questions next asked are, usually: How much will he love his wife,
why he marries her, and what is his profession. These questions are
answered in the following manner:</p>

<p>Gather up the cards, shuffle them thoroughly, and let the person
cut them three times. Then tell off the cards upon the table, as you
recite the following sentence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Heartily, painfully,</div>
  <div class="verse">Beyond all measure,</div>
  <div class="verse">By fits and starts,</div>
  <div class="verse">Not a bit in the world.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>You repeat this sentence until the king of hearts makes his appearance.
If it happens that, as you lay this upon the table, you pronounce
the word  “heartily,” he will love his future wife heartily, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, as to why he marries her. Count off the cards upon the
table, while you repeat the following sentence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">For love, for her beauty,</div>
  <div class="verse">For his parents’ command,</div>
  <div class="verse">For her bright, golden dollars,</div>
  <div class="verse">For counsel of friends.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The sentence by which you discover what is his profession is the
following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Gentleman, alderman, clergyman, doctor,</div>
  <div class="verse">Merchant, broker, professor, major,</div>
  <div class="verse">Mechanic, lawyer, shipmaster, tailor.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This method of telling fortunes is very entertaining in society, when
you have not the book to find more particular answers.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3><a id="A_METHOD_BY_WHICH_TO_DISCOVER_IF_YOUR_WISH_WILL_BE_FULFILLED"></a>A METHOD BY WHICH TO DISCOVER IF YOUR WISH WILL
BE FULFILLED.</h3>

<p>Take a pack of cards, shuffle it, and let the person inquiring cut
three times; then place singly five cards upon the table, and upon
each of these cards another, taken from the top, and so on, until the
pack is exhausted, and the cards are divided into five nearly equal
heaps.</p>

<p>The person in question now selects a suit, spades or clubs, &amp;c.—or
a card may previously be drawn to determine the suit.</p>

<p>Suppose diamonds is the chosen suit: you take up the first heap,
and throw away all the cards until you come to a matadore of diamonds.
(The matadores are the ace, king, queen, knave and ten.)
You do the same with the other heaps. If any one of the heaps does
not contain a matadore, you cast it entirely aside.</p>

<p>The heaps which are left you now place one upon another in order,
beginning at the left hand, and, without shuffling them, you lay them
in five heaps, and proceed as before. This time there are, of course,
fewer cards, beside matadores, than before. After having cast aside
the cards which you meet with before finding a matadore, you take
up the heaps, and, without shuffling them, lay them in five heaps, for
the third time. This third and last time, you must, if your wish is to
be fulfilled, be able to discard all the cards except the matadores. If
any other cards are left in the heaps, your wish will not be granted.</p>

<h2><a id="TELLING_FORTUNES_BY_DOMINOES_AND_DICE"></a>TELLING FORTUNES BY DOMINOES AND
DICE.</h2>

<p>The telling of fortunes by the spots on Dominoes and Dice is a
very ancient custom, and has always been practised by the most celebrated
astrologers and fortune-tellers. The calculations have all to
be made by drawing a horoscope from each domino and the spots on
each side of a die; therefore the process is exceedingly tedious. We
have given in the following pages the results of three years’ experimental
labor on this subject; not constant labor, for there are but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
few hours in each year when the stars are in the right position to
draw the horoscope of any particular domino. A good many of the
signs predicted here have been proved to be correct within the personal
knowledge of the writer, and he doubts not they will all be
found to be accurate.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3><a id="METHOD_OF_TELLING_FORTUNES_WITH_DOMINOES"></a>METHOD OF TELLING FORTUNES WITH DOMINOES.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg"  alt="A circle of dominoes" />
</div>

<p>Shuffle the dominoes well on a smooth table, with their faces downward,
then draw one and see what it signifies according to the description
given below.</p>

<p>It is useless for any person to draw more than three dominoes at
one time of trial, or in one and the same month, as they will only deceive
themselves. Shuffle the dominoes each time of choosing; to
draw the same domino twice makes the answer stronger.</p>

<p>Be very particular and do not attempt to tell your fortune by dominoes
on <i>Friday</i> or <i>Monday</i>.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h4>SIGNIFICATION OF THE DOMINOES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Double-Six.</span> Denotes much riches by speculation, and a happy
and prolific marriage. It is not good to farmers as far as relates to
crops and success in their calling, but it foretells that their lands will
rise in value, and that they can make money by selling out. If a girl
turns this domino to learn her fate in matrimonial matters, it is a sign
she will marry rich, and have a large family of children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Six-Five.</span> If you are in search of employment, this domino shows
that you will succeed by proper perseverance. If in love, do not be
discouraged by any rebuffs, for success awaits you. If you have
planted a crop, or about to plant one, it will yield nobly. In money
matters exclusively, you may not be fortunate, as the domino is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
lucky for money. If your wife is about to give birth to a child, and
you try your fortune with special reference to such birth, this domino
foretells its early death. If you are about to buy real estate, you will
be lucky in the purchase—if to buy silverware, jewelry, or a watch,
you will get cheated. If you expect a legacy, you will probably be
lucky and get it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Six-Four.</span> This domino denotes early marriage and much happiness;
the sexes of the children will be about equally divided, and
they will live, but will leave home early—the girls to marry, and the
boys to do for themselves. It denotes neither poverty nor riches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Six-Three.</span> This domino denotes constancy and affection. It is
an excellent domino for lovers, who will marry early, and enjoy
much happiness. It is also a sign of riches and honors; and no
troubles of any account will mar your fortune. There is some danger,
however, that you will die at middle age, but if you survive that period
you will live to a good old age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Six-Two.</span> Is an excellent domino for lovers, as it foretells a happy
marriage. A gentleman turning this domino, will get an orderly and
economical wife, and a lady will have equal good fortune in a thrifty
and industrious husband. Those who turn this domino for luck in
business matters, will realize all and more than they expect. To
dishonest and selfish people, however, the domino is fatal. If it is
turned to determine the result of any scheme that is not fair and
above-board, it foretells ill-success and exposure. To a married lady
who expects to present her husband with an heir, it presents a beautiful
and healthy child, and one who will excel as a mathematician,
and (if a boy) will probably become distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Six-One.</span> This domino foretells to young people that they will
marry twice, and the second marriage will be the happiest of the two.
To married people it is a sign they will be better off in middle age
than when young, and that one child will be faithful and remain with
them, while the others will seek their fortunes away from home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Six-Blank.</span> If you turn this domino you will hear of the death of
an esteemed friend, or an acquaintance—will experience the loss of a
relative or member of your family—or some one will die in whom you
are interested. To a farmer, or the owner of horses or other animals,
it may denote the loss of some of the animals rather than human
beings; but it foretells death in some shape, and may even mean to
warn you of your own decease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double-Five.</span> Is a decidedly lucky domino in everything you undertake.
It foretells success in all enterprises, but does not assure
you that you will become rich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five-Four.</span> This domino shows to a lady that she will probably
marry a poor man, have a large family of children, and then become
a widow. He may be pretty well off, to appearance, when she marries
him, but if it be so, she will find that he has debts and expensive
habits that will bring him to poverty and the grave. It is not a good
domino for money matters, for if you have lost money, or if people
owe you, the turning of this domino shows that you will not be apt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
to get the cash. To a farmer it is a sign of good crops; but it is also
a sign that something unfortunate will occur in connection with the
farm—such as cattle lost or injured, or property of some kind destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five-Three.</span> Denotes ample means, without any other peculiarity
of fortune. If you turn this domino you may calculate you will
never be poor, and may become quite wealthy. But to one already
wealthy, it shows that though he may not become poor, he will never
be any better off than he then is, and perhaps not so well off. To
young people the domino denotes comfortable circumstances after
marriage, but not over-zealous love. It shows no positive bad luck
in love matters, at the same time that it does not assure you of devoted
attachment of your proposed partner for life, of either sex. On
the whole, it is a pretty fair domino for any one to turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five-Two.</span> If you are in love, you will probably be unfortunate;
for though you may get the person you want, and an apparently
happy marriage may follow, it will prove an unhappy one in the end.
Nevertheless, your happiness may continue for some time after marriage.
To a gentleman this domino foretells a thrifty and industrious
wife, though one with an unhappy temper or disposition. To a single
lady it denotes thrift and independence as long as she remains
single. If a man is engaged in a speculation, or is about starting any
new enterprise, he will not be likely to succeed. If you are a candidate
for office, you will be defeated. On the whole, this is not a
lucky domino for gentlemen, though for ladies it is a pretty fair one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five-One.</span> Is a jolly domino for persons fond of excitement. It
predicts that you will receive an invitation to a dinner, or social gathering,
or to some place where you will enjoy yourself. If a married
lady turns this domino it is a sign she will present her husband with
a triple addition to his family—all boys. To a young lady it predicts
a beau, who will not be rich or refined, but rather a rough customer,
and she will discard him and marry another. If you expect to earn
or to receive money, this domino is one of disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five-Blank.</span> If a man turns it, he will be either a gambler or a
rich rogue, if he has brains enough, and if his intellect is not sufficient,
he will probably be a small swindler, or the favored lover of a
lewd woman, or both. Although these will be his characteristics,
yet circumstances may place him in a different position; but he will
always be mercenary, selfish, impudent, and without pride of character.
To a girl this domino foretells an unhappy marriage, and misfortune
by that means; but if she remains single, and keeps clear of
lovers, she will avoid the ill omen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double-Four.</span> Is a good and smooth domino for lovers, for farmers,
and for laboring people of all kinds. On the contrary, lawyers, doctors,
or professional men who turn it, will probably have a spell of
hard times to encounter. To little girls and boys it predicts that they
will soon be invited to a party, and have much pleasure. If any one
is about to give a party, and turns this domino, he or she may count
on a first-rate time, for everything will go on well, and the party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
will be a decided success. It likewise predicts that a wedding will
come off very soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Four-Three.</span> Those who turn this domino will marry young, live
happily, and will not probably have more than one child that will
live. It denotes neither poverty nor riches. To a couple who are
childless, it is a sign of a second marriage. If a married person who
has children turns this domino, it is a sign that the family will be reduced
by death or long absence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Four-Two.</span> Foretells a change in your circumstances, condition,
family, relations, or your ideas. It is not known what the change
will be, but that there will really be a change, fate has ordained. It
may be nothing at all serious, or it may be something that will affect
your whole life. For instance, a young person who turns this domino
may get married—that will be an important change, but whether the
marriage will be a happy one, is not known. A married person may
lose their partner—a man may fail in business, or may become pious
and join the church—a family may break up housekeeping and take
board, or may lose a favorite child. Indeed, a thousand little incidents
may occur in life which will cause a change in your usual routine.
To farmers and persons who work hard for a living, the change
will probably be a favorable or happy one. To rich and lazy people
it will be an unfortunate one. To any other than these two classes
it is uncertain what the nature of it will be. If you have offended
your lover, or any particular friend, this domino shows that you will
soon make up and become stronger friends than ever. It is a lucky
domino for farmers in business matters, although it does not point
out any particular good fortune that awaits them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Four-One.</span> Those who turn this domino will marry happily, and
no uncommon event will mar their nuptials: the omen connected
with it usually points to childless couples who are well off; and I
find that where children are born, the parties will lose their wealth
and position in proportion to the number of their offspring, which
will never exceed four. In most cases there will be no children, but
ample means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Four-Blank.</span> Is an unfortunate domino for lovers, as it foretells
quarrels and separations, old maids and old bachelors. A girl who
has a lover, and turns this domino to find out his peculiarities, had
better look somewhere else at once, for she will certainly either lose
or discard him. It is the same with a gentleman—he will never
marry the girl he then expects to, and may be jilted. To married
people the domino gives a prolific promise. A married lady who
turns it will probably have twins or triplets at her next maternity.
If you think to entrust a secret to a friend, this domino denotes that
it will not be kept. It also foretells that your future husband or
wife will be a very credulous person—perhaps a believer in Spiritualism
or some other absurd doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double-Three.</span> Denotes immense riches, but has no allusion to
matrimony. It is an excellent domino for any one to turn, as it
points to money in abundance, and does not intimate any unhappi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>ness:
therefore, the person who turns it will get plenty of cash, and
be happy or not, as fate may ordain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three-Two.</span> Is a fortunate domino in the following cases: marriage,
love-making, recovering stolen property, going on a journey,
entering into a speculation, planting a crop, collecting a debt, or making
a purchase. This domino shows also that you may be lucky in
collecting some old claim or debt that you had given up as lost. It
is bad for gamblers, for a woman about to give birth to a child, and
for peddlers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three-One.</span> A young girl who turns this domino will be in danger
of losing her chastity; therefore let her be careful. A married woman
turning it will have an outside admirer who will flatter her with
a view to an improper intimacy. To a man it foretells the loss of
money through his illicit intercourse with the opposite sex. It is not
a favorable domino to any one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three-Blank.</span> This domino denotes that your sweetheart is artful
and deceitful. If you get married, your wife will be either shrewish,
or vain and unprincipled, and perhaps run away and disgrace you.
To a girl it foretells a putty-head of a husband—one who is easily
influenced, and whom she can wind round her finger. If you turn this
domino, it is a sign you will soon be invited to a party and there
make a new acquaintance, with whom you will afterwards have a quarrel.
If a married man or woman turns it, it predicts a family quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double-Two.</span> The turning of this domino denotes success in love
matters and much happiness in the married state, together with good
children who will live and be prosperous. It also denotes success
in any undertaking, and thrift, though not great riches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two-One.</span> The turning of this domino denotes to a lady that she
will marry young, and that her husband will die, leaving her a large
property, and childless. For a long time she will be a gay, rich
widow, but will be caught at last, and marry happily. To a young
man it denotes a life of luxury; he will never marry, but will be a
favorite of the ladies, and have several mistresses. It is not a good
domino for business men, as it foretells losses by failures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two-Blank.</span> The turning of this domino denotes poverty and bad
luck. To a marriageable young woman it predicts a poor, dissipated
and dishonest husband. On the birth of a child—if a boy, it is a
sign that he will be poor and shiftless, and perhaps dishonest—if a
girl, that she will not marry well. It is not a bad domino for a girl
who lives unmarried, for she may do very well alone. It is a domino
of good luck to thieves and bad people. If they turn it, it is a sign
of success in any dishonest undertaking. Should you turn this domino
in reference to a journey, it shows that you will go in safety. It
predicts an easy deliverance in case you are attacked and should be
obliged to defend yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double-Ace.</span> Denotes affectionate constancy and happiness in the
marriage state. It is an excellent domino to turn, both for lovers
and married people, as besides the above it indicates a competency
of this world’s goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double-Blank.</span> To turn this domino is the worst sign in the whole
set, and is only favorable to misers, usurers, gamblers, and unprincipled
cheats and seducers. To any heartless, selfish person, the turning
of this domino foretells good luck—to all others disappointment.
We hope that no young girl turning a domino to ascertain her fortune
as to marriage will turn this one, for it surely foretells disappointment
and sorrow. If she has a lover, and should he marry her,
he will desert her afterwards. In business matters, too, it is decidedly
unfavorable, and is a sign that your business will decrease. If
you are wanting a situation, you will not be likely to get it, and if
anything is lost or stolen, it will not probably be recovered again.
It is generally a pretty bad domino for decent people—but a good
one for all the dishonest ones, who, if they have got anything by
trickery and fraud, will be apt to enjoy it.</p>

<h3><a name="METHOD_OF_TELLING_FORTUNES_WITH" id="METHOD_OF_TELLING_FORTUNES_WITH">METHOD OF TELLING FORTUNES WITH
DICE.</a></h3>


<p>Take three dice, shake them well in the box with your left hand,
and then cast them out on a board or table, on which you have previously
drawn a circle with chalk; count the number of spots on the
uppermost sides of the dice, and look at the signification of the numbers,
as given below. Be careful and do not attempt to tell your fortune
on Mondays or Wednesdays, as they are unlucky days for dice.
To throw the same number twice at one trial, shows news from
abroad, be the numbers what they may. If the dice roll over the
circle, the number thrown goes for nothing, but the occurrence shows
sharp words, and if they fall to the floor, it is blows; in throwing out
the dice, if one remains on top of the other, it is a present of which
I leave the ladies to take care.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h4><a id="SIGNIFICATION_OF_THE_SPOTS_ON_DICE"></a>SIGNIFICATION OF THE SPOTS ON DICE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Three.</span> If a young girl throws this number, (three aces,) it foretells
that she will have numerous lovers, and if she marries will have
a good crop of children, and then become a widow. To a young man
it denotes that he will never marry, but will be a great favorite of the
ladies, and probably a gay seducer. If a married person throws it,
he or she will become a widower or widow, as the case may be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Four.</span> To throw this number denotes frivolity in love matters.
Unmarried persons who throw it will have many lovers or sweethearts,
and will not be fully satisfied with either. It foretells to a
married woman that her husband admires the sex generally quite as
much as he does her; but it also denotes that she will have many
children, and that both herself and husband will live to raise them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five.</span> To throw this number of spots of the dice, foretells good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
luck in a land speculation to any one who is about buying lands. It
is a very good number for farmers, prognosticating a fortunate season
to come. To lovers it shows that some obstacle will present itself to
their marriage, or else that they will quarrel. In a family it is a sign
that some person will soon visit there that is not welcome. If you
are about to go a journey, and throw this number, you will meet
some one who will bother you, or that you dislike, or else some disagreeable
accident will happen; but the accident will not be serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Six.</span> If a girl throws this number, (three deuces,) it denotes that she
will be of gay disposition and have many lovers, but will never marry;
if she escapes illicit connections, she will be fortunate, and probably get
some money by will. To a young man it denotes that he will marry
a gay wife, who will be of loose principles; and also that he himself
will keep a mistress, and perhaps become a gambler. He will not be
poor as long as he is young and attractive, but he will either die
young or become poor in middle age. To gamblers, the throwing of
this number is a sign of success in winning money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven.</span> If a man throws this number it foretells that he will never
marry, but will be lucky in business speculations. A young lady
who throws it will be apt to marry a wealthy husband, though he
may not be an agreeable companion. To farmers and mechanics it is
not a particularly bad number, though it does not promise them much
success, and it foretells that they will have pretty hard work to keep
even with the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight.</span> This is the miser’s throw; those who throw it will probably
be well off, though not rich. It foretells a miserly or stingy disposition,
and a character too close in money matters to be very prosperous.
If a girl throw this to test the character of her lover, she
may be assured that he will not be poor, though it is possible he may
lead her an unhappy life from his selfish and penurious habits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nine.</span> If you throw this number with the dice with reference to
your future husband or wife, be assured that you will be lucky in
your choice. It foretells an orderly, energetic and industrious person.
I should not want a better wife than this number predicts. To a
young girl it does not promise riches with a husband, but it foretells
thrift and plenty, and that she may be rich, too. It is a fair business
throw also—foretelling pretty good luck in everything except games
of chance, and predicting bad luck in such games.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten.</span> If a young girl throws this number, she will not marry very
soon, and perhaps not at all; but she will have good luck in other
matters, and rise above her present position in society. If a man
throws it, he will get a rich wife. It is a favorable number to the
male sex in love matters. A married woman who throws it will rise
in the world, or have a legacy left to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eleven.</span> This throw foretells extravagance and fondness of show
and display. Those who throw it, or for whose fortune it may be
thrown, will probably have the command of means, but all will be
spent in gimcracks, parties of pleasure, and in adorning the person;
and though they may not come to poverty, they will leave nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
but debt to their heirs. To laboring people it denotes that they will
be always in debt, and live above their means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twelve.</span> Shows that an event of some kind is soon to occur in
your affairs, either for good or evil. To a farmer or a laboring man
it will probably be fortunate, but it may be otherwise. To a banker,
a money-dealer, or a jeweler, it is generally a bad omen—to other
trades, uncertain. It has no special reference to love matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirteen.</span> I hope no virtuous young girl will ever be so unfortunate
as to throw this number, unless she be possessed of a resolution as firm
as a rock, for it foretells that she will be sorely tempted to become
profligate. It is emphatically the throw of an unchaste female. If a
man throws this number, it is a sign that he will never marry, but
will associate with harlots, or live with a woman who is not his wife;
if he throws it with a view to discover the character of his lady-love,
he may guess the result.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourteen.</span> This is the gambler’s throw, and denotes dishonesty
and an unprincipled disposition in men, and misfortune in women. If
a man throws it, he will be either a gambler or a rich rogue, if he
has brains enough, and if his intellect is not sufficient, he will probably
be a small swindler, or the favored lover of a lewd woman, or
both. Although these will be his characteristics, yet circumstances
may place him in a different position, but he will always be mercenary,
selfish, impudent, and without pride of character. To a girl
this number foretells an unhappy marriage, and misfortune by that
means; but if she remains single, and keeps clear of lovers, she will
avoid the ill omen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifteen.</span> If you are a speculating character—a buyer of lottery
tickets or lottery policies, or are engaged in any games of chance,
such as gambling, horse-racing, shooting at a mark, betting, or in
fact any scheme that you expect to win money by, this number foretells
bad luck and discomfiture. If you try to test your luck in any
such matters, and this number turns up, you may be sure you will
lose, and had better give up at once. If you want to buy land, you
will be apt to get a good bargain and be fortunate. This number
foretells good luck to a farmer putting in his crops, and the same to
a girl choosing a husband; for though she may not get a rich man,
yet he will be industrious, thrifty, comfortable, and good-hearted. To
consumptive people this throw is not a favorable one, as in many
cases it predicts a short life to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixteen.</span> This is an unlucky number to a merchant, a banker, or a
mechanic. It foretells bad luck of some kind, though it is generally
a forerunner of a brisk and profitable business. An excellent run of
business may come first, and the bad luck afterwards, or <i>vice versa</i>,
but the misfortune is sure to come in somewhere. To a farmer this
throw foretells abundant crops, and to a gold-digger good luck and
plenty of the precious metal. A young girl who throws it will get a
thrifty husband, and have a numerous family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventeen.</span> If you are a girl, and think of getting married, you
will be apt to lose your lover unless he is a farmer, a gardener, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
well-digger, a gold-miner, a brewer, a coal-heaver, a grave-digger, or
some occupation that makes him use a shovel a good deal. If you
think of marrying any such man, this throw is a good one. For a
man of any other occupation, it foretells disappointment. To a young
man, this number shows that by perseverance and industry he will
do well in the world—that his luck will be good if he only tries his
best to get along. If you have had anything stolen from you, or
have lost valuable property while walking or riding, this throw is unfavorable;
you will probably never recover what you have lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eighteen.</span> People who throw this number may congratulate themselves,
as it foretells riches, honors, and a happy and contented life.
It predicts unexceptionable prosperity in all kinds of business, good
luck in love matters, and advancement to those who are honorably
ambitious. To rogues and dishonest people it is an omen of discomfiture,
detection and punishment.</p>

<p>(<i>See Engraving.</i>)</p>


<h4>1. <span class="smcap">Linea Vitalis.</span></h4>

<p>If this line is wanting or nearly so, it is by no means a good sign.
It signifies a feeble understanding, a faint heart, and a short, sickly
life. This, however, is not the signification in every case; it often
indicates, especially with the ladies, changeableness of feeling, a disposition
easily influenced by others, and a proneness to enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_110.jpg"  alt="Hand, naming lines and digits" />
</div>

<p>The length of life is in proportion to the
length of the line of Life. It begins between
♃ and ♀ and it is here that you
commence with the prophecy.</p>

<p>Each knot in this line denotes an obstacle,
or, at least, something momentous in
life. Each crossing by smaller lines, some
unpleasant occurrence. The larger the
cross, the greater the misfortune.</p>

<p>In most cases one or more lines run
from the Natural line to the line of Life.
This indicates the partner of one’s life.
The point where the junction takes place
denotes the point of time of the marriage.
If this occurs near the commencement of
the line, of course the marriage will take
place early in life. If two lines unite with
the line of Life it indicates two husbands
(or wives). If no line joins it, the person
will remain unmarried.</p>

<p>The clearer and more distinct the line
of Life, the happier the person’s life.
When it is fine, deep and sharply defined,
it denotes an energetic, and at the same
time a noble character.</p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap">Linea Naturalis.</span></h4>

<p>A regular length and good appearance of this line denotes excellent
digestive organs. Large crosses occurring in its course signify imprudence,
precipitation.</p>


<h4>3. <span class="smcap">Linea Mensalis.</span></h4>

<p>If it is well defined it indicates an amorous temperament; if accompanied
by a side line, it signifies good fortune in love and wedlock.
If it is very broad, happiness in domestic life. If it is interrupted it
denotes that sad calamity, infidelity.</p>


<h4>4. <span class="smcap">Linea Hepatica.</span></h4>

<p>If it is complete and tolerably long, it promises robust health, a
clear understanding, and good humor. If it throws out branches
near its commencement it signifies wit, acuteness, presence of mind,
a spirit of mischief, perhaps falsehood.</p>


<h4>5. <span class="smcap">Linea Rascetta.</span></h4>

<p>When it is complete and unbroken, it denotes good fortune in all
matters of importance.</p>

<p>From the ring finger (Solis ⨀) there commonly runs one or more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
lines into the Linea Mensalis. These denote the various inclinations
of the heart. If but a single line is actually visible, and if this is
deep and long, the person loves or will love faithfully and warmly.
If a number of smaller lines are found in its place, the person is inconstancy
itself, a butterfly roving from flower to flower. Add up all
these little lines, and the sum will give you the number of times the
person will fall in love.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a id="PHRENOLOGY_AND_PHYSIOGNOMY"></a>PHRENOLOGY AND PHYSIOGNOMY.</h2>

<p>The science of Phrenology teaches how to discover from the formation
of the skull the qualities of the soul, and to draw conclusions as
to the character of an individual. The whole head, accordingly, is
divided into organs. The following are the principal ones, and are
all that are necessary for the reader’s instruction. To enter more
deeply into the subject would exceed our limits.</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Memory.</li>
<li>2. Causality.</li>
<li>3. Benevolence.</li>
<li>4. Approbativeness.</li>
<li>5. Painting.</li>
<li>6. Energy.</li>
<li>7. Imagination.</li>
<li>8. Inclination to Melancholy.</li>
<li>9. Mischievousness.</li>
</ul>

<p>(<i>See Engraving.</i>)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg"  alt="Organs marked on image of head" />
</div>

<p>According as these organs are more or less elevated and well formed
that peculiarity of character which they indicate is more or less present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Physiognomy, or the Features of the Head and Face</span>, teaches
us to judge of the character of a person and of events connected with
his destiny from the shape, color and expression of his features. If
my fair readers would like to know how many husbands they are to
have, they have only to knit their eyebrows closely together, and
count the folds of the skin formed by this movement.</p>

<p>If they wish to see how many years they have to live, let them
elevate their brows as much as possible, and then count the cross
folds in the forehead. Subtract the number found from one hundred,
and the remainder is the number of the years which it is allotted you
to pass upon this earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Nose.</span> A bold, projecting nose, usually called a Roman
nose, denotes an enterprising temper. In general a large nose is a
good sign. A long nose is a sign of good sense, a stumpy one generally
indicates the contrary. A perfectly straight nose denotes a
high and noble spirit, unless the expression of the eyes contradicts
this judgment, and then it denotes great stupidity. A turned up nose
signifies a spirit of mischief, wit, forwardness, that is, if it is not too
stumpy. A very small nose indicates good nature, yet at the same
time a complete want of energy. A red nose denotes a cheerful temper,
or an inclination to drink, as all the world knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Lips.</span> Very thick lips indicate either great stupidity or very
great genius. Very fine thin lips denote falsehood, especially if they
are usually compressed. Swelling lips, if generally compressed, denote
great decision of character, a philosophical turn of mind, and
oftentimes somewhat of obstinacy. A mouth always open says as
plain as words can speak,  “I am a calf.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of Dimples.</span> Dimples in the cheeks signify roguery. But the dimple
in the chin the God of Love has himself imprinted with his own
divine finger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Eye.</span> The soul, however, dwells particularly in the eyes,
and the faculty is inborn with every man to understand their language
without ever having studied it. At least it should be so; the
eyes should be like an open book, which all may read and understand.
But as all eyes are not to be trusted, and will sometimes lead you
astray, I will give you, my dear readers, a few rules to guide you in
your path through life.</p>

<p>A clear eye, with the pupil in continual, slightly tremulous movement,
denotes a good memory, yet something of selfishness with slowness
of comprehension.</p>

<p>An eye which, while the person speaks, roves hither and thither,
denotes a deceiver. Very quiet eyes which have an imposing effect
upon you, and embarrass you by their great repose, signify great self-command,
yet, at the same time, great self-complacency.</p>

<p>Eyes which ordinarily appear impressive, yet often suddenly flash
forth a clear pleasant light, denote true-heartedness and honesty,
coupled with a sound understanding.</p>

<p>Eyes which have always an inquisitive expression in them, and
then suddenly, when they turn to address a person, have an exceedingly
kind expression, are not to be trusted. This indicates a suspicious
temper, and he who does not trust his fellow-man, can seldom
himself be trusted.</p>

<p>An eye in which the white has a yellowish tinge, and is streaked
with reddish veins, denotes vehement passions.</p>

<p>Very blue eyes, betray a temper inclined to coquetry.</p>

<p>Gray eyes, intelligence.</p>

<p>Greenish, falsehood, and a disposition to tittle-tattle.</p>

<p>Yellowish, great phlegm.</p>

<p>Black, a passionate lively temperament.</p>

<p>Brown, a kind, good, happy disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>A pair of eyes which looks every one cheerfully and frankly in the
face, with an air of simple joy and unaffected innocence, yet, when
surprised, droops to the ground, with a certain sly bashfulness, or,
when offended by another’s glance, turns aside blushing and confused,
such a pair of eyes, indicates an amiable character, a faithful heart, a
sound understanding, and a pure soul.</p>

<p>A being with such a pair of eyes we cannot help loving, let the
eyes be black, brown, blue, gray, green, or yellow, let the nose be
stumpy, and the features ill-shaped, no one can help regarding their
possessor with a feeling of hearty kindness and good will, if not with
actual love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Eye-Brows.</span> Upright eyebrows are amiable; the eyebrows
hanging over, indicate an effeminate person; the brows very
hairy, denote an industrious, affectionate man; the brows extending
to the temples, usually signify a slovenly man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Ears.</span> Open ears usually indicate but little reason; great
ears not too much wisdom; very small ears foolishness; square ears
of medium size, prudence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Nostrils.</span> The nostrils thick and strong, betoken strength;
if round, fair, and drawn in length, they are a sign that the person is
merry and courageous; if narrow and round, they are mostly indicative
of an envious and foolish person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Mouth.</span> A very large mouth, with the upper lip hanging
over, usually signifies a foolish, unsteady person, a rash man and a
babbler. A mouth not too large, indicates a bold and courageous
man; and a small mouth, a clever man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Face.</span> A lean face is an indication of a wise man; the face
plain and fat, denotes a person addicted to strife. The face without
any rising and swelling, indicates a penurious person; a sad face
sometimes denotes foolishness, and at other times wisdom; a fat face
indicates a man to be inclined to untruth; a round face signifies folly;
a great face denotes a man slow about business; a well-proportioned
face indicates a person to have virtuous qualities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Nails on the Fingers.</span> Broad nails show the person to be
bashful, fearful, but of gentle nature. When there is a certain white
mark at the extremity of them, it shows that the person has more
honesty than subtlety. White long nails denote much sickness, but
are sometimes indicative of strength and deceit. If upon the white
anything appears at the extremity that is pale, it denotes short life;
but if the white is clear and smooth, it signifies long life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Head.</span> A large head shows a person stupid, and dull of
apprehension; also a very small head signifies the same; but the
head of a man being neither great nor small, is the prognostic of a
wise man; for all extremes are irregular and a deviation from nature,
and experience has made it manifest, that a great head and small
members do always produce great indiscretion and folly in either man
or woman; but we must also consider the several parts of the head:
and first,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Forehead.</span> A large forehead shows a liberal man; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
the forehead narrow, denotes a foolish person; a long forehead shows
one apt to learn; a high forehead, swelling and round, is a sign of a
crafty man, and a coward; a forehead full of wrinkles, shows a man
to be envious and crafty.</p>

<p>But in forming your opinions of men from these or other indications,
you should always bear in mind that there is no rule without
an exception.</p>

<p>These little marks on the skin, although they appear to be the
effect of chance, or accident, and might easily pass with the unthinking
for things of no moment, are nevertheless of the utmost consequence,
since from their color, situation, size, and figure, may be
accurately gathered the temper of, and the events that will happen
to the person bearing them; though moles are, in their substances,
nothing else than excrescences, or ebullitions which proceed from the
state of the blood whilst the fœtus is confined in the womb, yet they
are not given in vain, as they are generally characteristic of the disposition
and temper of those that bear them; and it is also proved by
daily experience, that from the shape, situation, and other circumstances,
they bear a strong analogy to the events which are to happen
to a person in future life. But before I presume to give any
directions to those who are to form the prognostic, who are desirous
to be duly enabled to pronounce an infallible judgment, I shall, in the
first place, teach you herein the common prognostications by moles
found in the various parts of the body, according to the doctrine of
the ancients. And, first, it is essentially necessary to know the size
of the mole, its color, whether it be perfectly round, oblong, or angular;
because each of these will add to or diminish the force of the
indication. The larger the mole, the greater will be the prosperity
or adversity of the person; the smaller the mole, the less will be his
good or evil fate. If the mole is round, it indicates good; if oblong,
a moderate share of fortunate events; if angular, it gives a mixture
of good and evil; the deeper the color, the more it announces favor
or disgrace; the lighter, the less of either. If it is very hairy, much
misfortune may be expected; if but few long hairs grow upon it, it
denotes that your undertakings will be prosperous.</p>

<p>We shall further remark only, that moles of a middling size and
color are those which we are now going to speak of. The rest may
be gathered from what we have just above mentioned, but as it may
frequently happen that modesty will sometimes hinder persons from
showing their moles, you must depend upon their own representation
of them for your opinion.</p>

<h4><a id="SIGNIFICATION_OF_MOLES"></a>SIGNIFICATION OF MOLES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm.</span> (<i>Right or Left.</i>) Show a courteous disposition, great forti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>tude,
resolution, industry, and conjugal fidelity; it foretells that the
person will fight many battles, and be successful in all; that you
will be prosperous in your undertakings, obtain a decent competency,

forty, but in a woman it shows that she will be survived by her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ankle.</span> Shows an effeminate disposition, given to foppery in dress,
and cowardice in a man; but in a woman it denotes courage, wit,
and activity—they foretell success in life with an agreeable partner,
accumulation of honors and riches, and much pleasure in the affairs
of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anus.</span> Around outside this place, a mole predicts that you will be
indolent, shiftless and poor, though of good capacity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm-Pits.</span> You will be very good looking, will become rich, and
be benevolent.</p>

you will have misfortune and defeat in the enterprises you may undertake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belly.</span> Shows an indolent, slothful disposition, given to gluttony,
very selfish, addicted to the pleasures of love and drink, negligent of
dress, and cowardly; it denotes small success in life, many crosses,
some imprisonment, and travelling, with losses by sea; but it foretells
that you will marry an agreeable partner of a sweet temper,
have children, who will be industrious and become very respectable
in life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bosom.</span> Shows a quarrelsome and unhappy temper, given to low

without many friends or much esteem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breast.</span> A mole on the right breast shows an intemperate and indolent
disposition, rather given to drink, strongly attached to the
joys of love; it denotes much misfortune in life, with a sudden reverse
from riches to poverty—many unpleasant and disagreeable accidents,
with a sober and industrious partner—many children, mostly girls,
who will all marry well, and be a great comfort to your old age; it
warns you to beware of pretended friends, who will harm you much.
A mole on the left breast shows an industrious and sober disposition,
amorous, and much given to walking; it denotes great success in life
and in love, that you will accumulate riches, and have many children,
mostly boys, who will make their fortunes by sea.</p>

<p>A mole under the left breast under the heart, shows a rambling,
unsettled disposition, given to drinking and little careful of your actions;
very amorous, and much given to indulge indiscriminately in
the pleasures of love, in a man. In a woman it indicates sincerity
in love, industry, and a strict regard for character; in life it denotes
a varied mixture of good and bad fortune, the former rather prevailing;
it denotes imprisonment for debt, but not of long duration. To
a woman it denotes easy labors, and children who will become rich,
live happy and respected, and marry well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

capacity; it is a sign that you will be too lazy to do anything for
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheek.</span> A mole on either cheek, shows an industrious, benevolent
and sober disposition, given to be grave and solemn, little inclined to
amorous sports, but of a steady courage and unshaken fortitude; it

<p><span class="smcap">Chin.</span> A mole on the chin shows an amiable and tranquil disposition,
industrious and much inclined to travelling, and the joys of
Venus; it denotes that the person will be highly successful in life,
accumulating a large and splendid fortune, with many respectable
and worthy friends, an agreeable conjugal partner, and fine children,
but also indicates losses by sea and in foreign countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ear.</span> On either ear it denotes riches in man or woman. If on the
lower tip of the ear, keep off the water, or you will be drowned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elbow.</span> A mole on either elbow shows a restless and unsteady
disposition, with a great desire for travelling—much discontented in
the married state and of an idle turn; it indicates no very great prosperity,
rather a sinking than rising condition, with many unpleasant
adventures, much to your discredit—marriage to a person who will
make you unhappy, and children who will be disobedient, and cause
you much trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eye.</span> A mole on the outside corner of either eye shows a sober,
honest, and steady disposition, much inclined to the pleasures of love;
it foretells a violent death, after a life considerably varied by pleasures
and misfortunes; in general it foreshadows that poverty will
keep at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="EYEBROW"></a>Eyebrow.</span> A mole on the right eyebrow signifies a sprightly, active
disposition, a great turn for gallantry, much courage, and great
perseverance; it denotes wealth and success in love, war and business;
that you will marry an agreeable mate, live happy, have children,
and die in an advanced old age, at a distance from home. On
the left eyebrow, temple, or side of the forehead, shows an indolent
peevish temper, a turn for debauchery and liquor, little inclined to
amorous sports and very cowardly; foretells poverty, imprisonment
and disappointments in all your undertakings, with undutiful children,
and a bad-tempered partner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Finger.</span> On either finger of either hand, it shows that you will be
a thief, or a dishonest person in some way, and never wealthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foot.</span> A mole on either foot shows a melancholy and inactive disposition,
little inclined to the pleasures of love, given to reading and
a sedentary life; they foretell sickness and unexpected misfortunes,
with many sorrows and much trouble, an unhappy choice of a partner
for life, with disobedient and unfortunate children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forehead.</span> If the mole is in the centre of the forehead it predicts
an active, industrious disposition, success in business, riches, honors,
a happy marriage, and a son who will be distinguished. But if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
mole is on the side of the forehead, the signification is not so favorable,
particularly if on the left side. (<i>See <a href="#EYEBROW">Eyebrow</a>.</i>) On the right side
of the forehead, or right temple, shows an active and industrious disposition,
much given to the sports of love; it denotes that she will be
very successful in life, marry an agreeable partner, and arrive at unexpected
riches and honors, and have a son, who will become a great
man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Groin.</span> On the right groin denotes riches and honors, but to be
accompanied with disease. On the left groin, you will have the sickness
without the wealth.</p>

that you will be distinguished in some way and become rich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hand.</span> Moles on either hand, if not on the fingers, denote wealth,
industry and energy in either sex. You will also be fortunate and
happy in your children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heart.</span> Over the heart, denotes wickedness, poverty and a hasty,
headstrong disposition. (<i>See <a href="#BREAST">Breast</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heel.</span> Shows a spiteful and malevolent disposition, but a person of
much energy, who may be successful in what he undertakes; that
he will be greatly talked about behind his back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hip.</span> A mole on either hip shows a contented disposition, given to
industry, amorous and faithful in engagements, of an abstemious
turn; it foretells moderate success in life, with many children, who
will undergo many hardships with great fortitude, and arrive at ease
and affluence, by dint of their industry and ingenuity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knee.</span> A mole on the left knee shows a hasty and passionate disposition,
extravagant and inconsiderate turn, with no great inclination
to industry and honesty, much given to the pleasures of Venus, but
possessed of much benevolence; it indicates good success in undertakings,
particularly in contracts, a rich marriage, and an only child.
On the right knee, shows an amiable temper, honest disposition and
a turn for amorous pleasures and industry; it foretells great success
in love, and the choice of a conjugal partner, with few sorrows, many
friends, and dutiful children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leg.</span> Moles on either leg show a person of a thoughtless, indolent
disposition, of an amorous turn, much given to extravagance and dissipation;
it denotes many difficulties through life, but that you will
surmount them all; it shows that imprisonment will happen to you
at an early age, but that in general you will be more fortunate than
otherwise; you will marry an agreeable person, who will survive
you, by whom you will have four children, two of which will die
young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lips.</span> A mole on either lip shows a delicate appetite, a sober disposition,
and much given to the pleasures of love, of an industrious and
benevolent turn; it denotes that the person will be successful in undertakings,
particularly in love affairs—that you will rise above your
present condition, and be greatly respected and esteemed—that you
will endeavor to obtain some situation, in which you will at first
prove unsuccessful, but afterward prevail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mons.</span> If a woman have a mole here, she will become the mother
of a great genius, or else the wife of a distinguished personage. It
is also a sign of riches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouth.</span> (<i>See <a href="#LIPS">Lips</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Navel.</span> On a woman it denotes many children, a good husband,
and an abundance of this world’s goods. On a man it is a sign he
will be lucky in all he undertakes, become very rich, and that he will
have a son who will be distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck.</span> In front of the neck is a good sign; you will rise to unexpected
honors and dignities, or become rich. On the back of the neck
it denotes misfortune. On either side of the neck it foretells that you
will become wicked or quarrelsome; and if on the right side, behind
the ear, it is a sign that you will be hung.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nipple.</span> In woman it is a sign that she will have a child that will
become famous and distinguished in the world. In man it denotes
that he will be fond of women, and spend much of his life in amours,
to the neglect of his proper business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nose.</span> Moles on any part of the nose, show a hasty and passionate
disposition, much given to amorous pleasures, faithful to engagements,
candid, open, and sincere in friendship, courageous and honest, but
very petulant, and rather given to drink; it denotes great success
through life and in love affairs—that you will become rich, marry
well, have fine children and be much esteemed by your neighbors
and acquaintance—that you will travel much, particularly by water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nostril.</span> Inside the nostril shows that you will be energetic and
persevering, and well off in the world; that you will get a good wife
or husband when you marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private Members.</span> Moles on these parts show a generous, open
and honest disposition, extremely disposed to gallantry, and the joys
of Venus, given to sobriety, and of undaunted courage; it denotes
great success in the latter part of life, but many and severe misfortunes
in the former, which will be borne with fortitude; it also foretells
a happy marriage and fine children, who will be happy, thrive
well, and grow rich and respectable: in man it shows that he will
have natural children, who will cut a great figure in life, but he will
experience much plague and vexation from their mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shin.</span> (<i>See <a href="#LEGS">Leg</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shoulder.</span> On the left shoulder shows a person of a quarrelsome,
unruly disposition, always inclined to dispute for trifles, rather indolent,
but much inclined to the pleasures of love, and faithful to the
conjugal vows. It denotes a life not much varied either with pleasures
or misfortunes; they indicate many children, and moderate success
in business, but dangers by sea. On the right shoulder shows
a person of a prudent and discreet temper, one possessed of much
wisdom, given to great secrecy, very industrious, but not very amorous,
yet faithful to conjugal ties; it indicates great prosperity and advancement
in life, a good partner, and many friends, with great profit
from a journey to a distant country, about the age of thirty-five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Side.</span> On either side, near any part of the ribs, shows an indolent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
cowardly disposition, given to excessive drinking, of an inferior capacity,
and little inclined to the pleasures of love; it denotes an easy
life, rather of poverty than riches, little respected, a partner of an
uneven and disagreeable temper, with undutiful children, who will
fall into many difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stomach.</span> If in the pit of the stomach, it shows a person of foppish
disposition, with little common sense, though much industry; it
also denotes riches. If lower down on the stomach, it is a sign that
you will promise more than you will perform, but will nevertheless be
highly esteemed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thigh.</span> On the right thigh, it shows the person to be of an agreeable
temper, inclined to be amorous, and very courageous: it also denotes
success in life, accumulation of riches by marriage, and many
fine children, chiefly girls. On the left thigh, shows a good and benevolent
disposition, a great turn for industry, and little inclined to
the pleasures of love: it likewise indicates many sorrows in life, great
poverty, unfaithful friends, and imprisonment by the false swearing
of some one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Throat.</span> It predicts a fortunate and wealthy marriage to either
sex. (<i>See <a href="#NECK">Neck</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tongue.</span> If a man shall have a mole on his tongue, it foretells
that he shall marry with a rich and beautiful woman of great celebrity.
On a woman’s tongue it denotes reserve of manner and wisdom;
also a fortunate marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wrist.</span> Moles on the wrist, or between that and the finger ends,
show the person to be of an ingenious and industrious turn, faithful
in his engagements, amorous and constant in his affections, rather of
a saving disposition, with a great degree of sobriety and regularity in
his dealings. It foreshows a comfortable acquisition of fortune, with
a good partner, and beautiful children, but some disagreeable circumstances
will happen about the age of thirty, which continue four or
five years. In a man, it denotes being twice married—in a woman
only once, but that she will survive her husband.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3><a id="TO_CHOOSE_A_HUSBAND_BY_THE_HAIR"></a>TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND BY THE HAIR.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Black.</span> Generally healthy, but apt to be cross; fond where he
fixes his attachment, and likely to make a good husband, and be careful
of his family: but if short and curly, is usually of an unsettled
temper, apt to show a want of prudence and carefulness in early life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White or Fair Hair.</span> Usually of a weak and sickly constitution,
fond of music, and will cut no great figure in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellow.</span> Fond, but inclinable to jealousy; and not always industrious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light Brown.</span> Sensible and good-humored, careful and attentive,
and, if saving of his income, generally makes a good husband; but
is apt to be otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dark Brown.</span> Neither very good nor very bad, middling in all
respects, but may be regarded as a pretty good character.</p>

but sometimes not very good-tempered and sensible, and
kind to a good wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red.</span> Will be cunning, artful, and fond of female companions; and

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>SIGNIFICATION OF THE NAILS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Broad Nails.</span> The person that hath the nails thus, is of gentle nature,
good, and pusillanimous, and a great fear to speak before great
persons, or those by whom they are in subjection; as also being
guilty of extreme bashfulness.</p>

<p>If about these nails there happens to be an excoriation of the flesh,
which is commonly called points—in these large nails it signifies the
party given to luxury, yet fearful, but usually given to excess.</p>

<p>When there is at the extremity a white mark, it signifies ruin
through negligence. The party has more honesty than subtlety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Nails.</span> He that hath the nails white and long, is sickly,
and subject to much infirmity by fevers; he is neat but not very
strong, because of his indispositions, much addicted to the company
of women by whom he will be greatly deceived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Narrow Nails.</span> The person with such nails, is desirous of attaining
knowledge in the sciences; but is never long at peace with his
neighbors. But if to narrowness they add some degree of length, the
person will be led away by ambitious propensities, always aiming at
things which he will be unable to obtain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Round Nails.</span> These declare a hasty person, yet good-natured and
very forgiving; a lover of knowledge, liberal sentiment, doing no one
any harm, and acting by his own principles, but too proud of his own
abilities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Long Nails.</span> When the nails are long, the person is of a good-natured
turn, but placing confidence in no man, being from his youth
familiar with duplicity, but not practising it, from his strict adherence
to virtue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fleshy Nails.</span> This description of nail indicates an idler, loving
to sleep, eat, and drink; not delighting in bustle and busy life; one
who prefers a narrow income without industry, to one of opulence to
be acquired by activity and diligence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Nails.</span> Little round nails discover a person to be obstinately
angry, seldom pleased, inclining to hate every one, as conceiving
himself superior to others, though without any reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pale or Lead-colored Nails.</span> A melancholy person, one who
through choice leads a sedentary life, and would willingly give up
all things for the sake of study, and to improve in the learned and
metaphysical branches of philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red and spotted Nails.</span> Choleric and martial, delighting in cruelty
and war; his chief pleasure being in plundering towns, where
every ferocious particle in human nature is glutted to satiety.</p>

<p>When you find any black spots upon the nails, they always signify
evil, as white ones are a token of good.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>FORTUNE-TELLING BY TEA OR COFFEE
GROUNDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To pour out the grounds of a tea or coffee cup.</span>—Pour the
grounds of coffee or tea into a white cup, shake them well about in
it, so that their particles may cover the surface of the whole cup;
then reverse it into the saucer, that all the superfluous parts may be
drained, and the figures required for fortune-telling be formed.</p>

<p>The person who acts as the fortune-teller, must always bend his or
her thoughts upon him or her who is to have their fortune told, and
on their rank in life, and profession, in order to give plausibility to
the predictions. It is not to be expected that upon taking up the cup,
the figures will be accurately represented as they are in reality, but
it will be quite sufficient if they bear some resemblance to any of the
emblems; and the more fertile the fancy is of the person that inspects
the cup, the more he or she will discover in it.</p>

<p>In other respects, every one who takes a pleasure in this amusement,
must be a judge under what circumstances he or she is to make
changes in point of time—speaking, just as it suits, in the present, the
past, or the future; in the same manner, their ingenuity ought to
direct them when to speak more or less pointedly with regard to sex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Roads</span>, or separate lines, indicate ways; if they are covered
with clouds, and, consequently, in the thick, they are said to be infallible
marks, either of many great or future reverses. But if they
appear in the clear and serene, are the surest token of some fortunate
change near at hand; encompassed with many points or dots, they
signify either a gain of money, or long life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ring</span> signifies marriage; if a letter is near it, it denotes to the
person that has their fortune told, the initial of the name of the party
to be married. If the ring is in the clear, it portends happy and
lucrative friendship; if surrounded with clouds, the contrary. But if
the ring appear at the bottom of the cup, it forebodes the probability
of a separation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Leaf of Clover</span> is, as well here as in common life, a lucky
sign. Its different position in the cup alone makes the difference;
because, if it be on the top, it shows that the good fortune is not far
distant; but it is subject to delay, if it be in the middle or at the
bottom. Should clouds surround it, it shows that many disagreeables
will attend the good fortune; in the clear, it prognosticates serene
and undisturbed happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Anchor.</span> The emblem of hope and commerce, implies success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>ful
business carried on by water and by land, if on the bottom of the
cup; at the top and in the clear part, it shows constant love and
fidelity; but in thick and cloudy parts, it denotes inconstancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Serpent</span>, always the emblem of falsehood and enmity, is likewise
here a general sign of an enemy. On the top or in the middle
of the cup, it promises to the consulting party that by his always acting
properly, his enemies will not be able to triumph over him; if in
the thick or cloudy part, he must watch his temper and actions very
carefully, to prevent great troubles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Coffin.</span> The emblem of death, prognosticates the same thing
here, or at least a long and tedious illness, if it be in the thick or
turbid. In the clear, it denotes long life; if in the thick, at the top
of the cup, it signifies a considerable estate likely to be made by cautious
industry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dog</span>, being at all times the emblem of fidelity or envy, has also
a two-fold meaning here. At the top, in the clear, it signifies true
and faithful friends: if the image be surrounded with clouds and
dashes, it shows that some whom you take for your friends are not
to be depended on; but if the dog be at the bottom of the cup, take
much care not to excite any person to envy or jealousy, or you will
have to dread the effects of both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lily.</span> If this emblem be at the top, or in the middle of the
cup, it signifies that the consulting party either has, or will have, a
good spouse; if it be at the bottom, it denotes anger. In the clear,
the lily further betokens a long and happy life; if clouded, or in the
thick, it portends trouble and vexations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Cross</span>, in general, predicts adversities; if it be at the top, and
in the clear, it indicates that the misfortunes of the party will soon be
at an end, or that he will, by careful conduct, easily get over them;
but if it appear in the middle, or at the bottom of the thick, the
party must expect many severe trials; if it appear with dots, either
in clear or thick, it promises recompense for sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clouds.</span> If they be more bright than dark, you may expect a
good result from your hopes; but if they are black, you may give it
up. Surrounded with dots, they imply success in trade, if you are
saving, and not too venturesome; the brighter they are, the greater
will be your happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sun</span>, is an emblem of the greatest luck and happiness, if in the
clear; but in the thick, it denotes a great deal of illness; surrounded
by dots or dashes, it foretells that, without much circumspection, an
alteration will soon take place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Moon.</span> If it appear in the clear, it denotes high honors; in
the dark or thick parts, it implies disappointment and sadness, which
will, however, pass without great prejudice. But if it be at the
bottom of the cup, the consulting party may expect, by industry and
prudent conduct, to be very fortunate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Star</span> denotes happiness, if in the clear, and at the top of the
cup; if clouded, or in the thick, it signifies long life, though exposed
to various troubles. If dots are about it, it foretells fortune and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
respectability. Several dots denote good children; surrounded by
dots, it predicts that, without good bringing up, they may cause you
grief and vexation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mountains.</span> If it present only one mountain, it indicates the favor
of people of rank; but several of them, especially in the thick, are
signs of powerful enemies; in the clear, they signify the contrary, or
friends in high life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Letter.</span> Signifies both pleasant and unpleasant news. If this
emblem is in the clear part, it denotes the speedy arrival of welcome
news; surrounded with dots, it announces the arrival of a remittance
of money; but hemmed in by clouds, it forebodes some melancholy
or bad tidings, a loss, or some other accident; if it be in the clear,
and accompanied by a heart, lovers may expect a favorable letter;
but in the thick it denotes the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tree.</span> One tree only is indicative of good health; a group of
trees in the clear part, betokens misfortunes, but which may be
avoided by carefulness and industrious habits; several trees, wide
apart, promise that your wishes will be accomplished; if they be encompassed
by dashes, it is a token that your fortune is in its blossom,
and requires only your own care and prudence to bring it to maturity;
if the trees be accompanied by dots, it is a sign of riches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Child.</span> In the clear part it bespeaks innocent intercourse between
the consulter and another person; in the thick part it signifies
crosses in love matters, and requires your utmost care to prevent
great expenses; and a family without means of support.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Signifies much joy in general. If in the clear, this
emblem shows very great happiness; but in the thick part it cautions
against jealousy. If dots surround the image, it shows children and
wealth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pedestrian.</span> Denotes in general a merchant, good business,
pleasant news, or the recovery of lost things. It denotes to the female
a kind and industrious husband; it also signifies some engagement,
and a short journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rider or Horseman.</span> Denotes a letter, good news from
abroad, a good situation, or the like; it also foretells that a fortune
is to be obtained by care and industry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mouse.</span> As this animal lives by stealth, it also is an emblem
of theft or robbery; if it be in the clear, it shows that your loss will
be easily prevented; but if in the thick, you must use your utmost
watchfulness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rose, or any other Flower.</span> Usually indicates success in
science or art by study; if married, good children may be expected,
and all the happy fruits, if they have but a good education and good
examples.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heart.</span> If it be in the clear, it signifies future pleasure. It
promises joy at receiving some money, if surrounded with dots. If a
ring or two hearts be together, it signifies that the party may expect
to be married; if a letter is perceptible near it, it shews the initial of
the person’s name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Garden, Wood, or Bush.</span> Signifies a large company. In the
clear and with leaves, it indicates good friends; in the thick, encompassed
with streaks, or if without leaves, it is a token of the caprices
of fortune, and warns the consulting party to be cautious whom they
take for their friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rod.</span> Predicts differences with people about matters relating
to legacies; in the thick, it denotes some affliction, which will require
your utmost care to avert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bird in general.</span> In the clear, it signifies that the disagreeables
and troubles with which you will have to combat, will only be
surmounted by persevering in doing good; in the thick, it is a sign
of good living; also a speedy journey, or voyage, which, if there be
dashes, is likely to be to a distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish in general.</span> Imply some lucky event by water, if in the
clear, which will either happen to the consulter, or be the means of
improving his affairs. If they are in the thick, the consulter may expect
to fish in troubled water. Surrounded with dots, his destiny
warns him to use diligence, temperance and frugality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lion, or any Ferocious Beast.</span> At the top, in the clear, it
signifies prosperity in your intercourse with people of quality. At the
bottom it warns the consulter to shun such intercourse and do nothing
to excite any person to envy his fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worms.</span> At the top, or in the middle of the cup, they denote good
luck in trade and in matrimony; below they warn you against rivals
in courtship, and against enviers in your trade and profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Style.</span> If combined with an hour-glass and in the thick, it
denotes imminent dangers of all kinds; in love, disappointment; but
in the clear, it signifies that your sweetheart is faithful and affectionate
toward you, and that you are likely to live a long and happy life.</p>

<h3>CHARMS AND MAGIC PROGNOSTICATIONS.</h3>

<p>Herewith I give a few mysterious magic formulas and prognostications,
for the most part hitherto known only to wise old men and
women, some of which I have had confided to me by learned astrologers,
and a few were revealed to me by Madame Le Normand, a celebrated
fortune-teller, in whose predictions the Emperor Napoleon put
great confidence.</p>

<h4>TO PREPARE A LOVE POTION.</h4>

<p>The following substances must be gathered in silence when the
full moon is in the heavens: Three white rose leaves, three red
rose leaves, three forget-me-nots, and five blossoms of Veronica.</p>

<p>All these things you must place in a vessel, then pour upon them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
five hundred and ninety-five drops of clear Easter water, and place
the vessel over the fire, or what is better still, over a spirit-lamp.
This mixture must be allowed to boil for exactly the sixteenth part
of an hour.</p>

<p>When it has boiled for the requisite length of time, remove it from
the fire, and pour it into a flask. Cork it tightly, and seal it, and it
will keep for years without losing its virtue.</p>

<p>That this potion is certain in its effect I myself will guarantee, for
I have gained more than thirty hearts by its help. Three drops swallowed
by the person whose love you desire, will suffice.</p>


<h4>ANOTHER MEANS TO COMPEL LOVE.</h4>

<p>Take a healthy, well-grown frog. Place it in a box which has been
pierced all over with holes with a stout darning needle or gimlet.
Then carry it in the evening twilight to a large ant-heap, place it in
the midst of the heap, taking care to observe perfect silence.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a week, repair to the ant-heap, take out the
box, and open it, when in place of the frog you will find nothing but
a skeleton. Take this apart very carefully, and you will soon find
among the delicate bones a scale shaped like that of a fish and a
hook. You will need them both. The hook you must contrive to
fasten in some way or other into the clothes of the person whose
affections you wish to obtain, and if he or she has worn it, if it is
only for a quarter of a minute, he will be constrained to love you,
and will continue to do so until you give him or her a fillip with the
scale.</p>

<p>This method is over three thousand years old, and it has been
practised by thirty-thousand of our ancestors with the most complete
success.</p>


<h4>FOR A GIRL TO ASCERTAIN IF SHE WILL EVER MARRY.</h4>

<p>Borrow a wedding-ring from a young married woman—the more
recently she has been married the better—and do not tell her, or let
her suspect your purpose; wear this ring on the third finger of your
left hand at least three hours after sunset before you retire to rest.
When you are ready to go to bed, take half a sheet of pure white paper,
with no rule marks or anything upon it, lay down the ring on
the paper, and mark round it so as to make a circle exactly its size:
you then write within the circle,  “With this ring I hope to wed:”
write your name over the top, and your age underneath; fold the paper
with a three-cornered love-letter fold, and put it under your pillow.
Before getting into bed, suspend the ring by a hair of your
head over the pillow so that it will hang about six inches above your
face. You will then dream of your future husband if you are ever
to marry. If you dream of several men, the one whose appearance
pleases you best will be the man. If you dream of women or girls
exclusively, you will never marry. Sometimes it may happen that
your dream is confused, and you have no clear recollection of it, or
perhaps you may not dream at all, in which case you must continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the charm, by keeping the paper under your pillow for three nights;
but the ring is not necessary after the first night.</p>


<h4>THE STRAW SIGN.</h4>

<p>If you find a blade of straw lying in your chamber, you may expect
a visitor that same day. If there is one grain upon the straw, the
visitor will be a gentleman, if not, a lady.</p>


<h4>THE SCISSOR OR KNIFE PROGNOSTIC.</h4>

<p>If a pair of scissors, a knife, or any other pointed instrument falls
accidentally from your hand, and sticks in the floor, so that it remains
upright, you may make every preparation for company, for be
assured they will not fail to come.</p>


<h4>THE CAT PORTENT.</h4>

<p>When the cat licks and trims herself, it is a sign of visitors, but
this is probably known to most of my readers already.</p>


<h4>SIGN OF VISITORS.</h4>

<p>Finally, a fourth sign of approaching visitors is the crying of the
magpie. Magpies, as is well known, are the most inquisitive creatures
upon the face of the earth. They fly from place to place, and
listen to everything. When they find out that any persons have
concluded to pay you a visit, they fly to you at full speed, and bring
you the news, for they are as chattering as they are inquisitive. They
perch themselves upon your house, or upon a tree which may stand
near it, or on the grass, and there sit and chatter until they think
you must have understood them. Therefore, always give heed to
these wise birds, for it is well to know when you are to expect
visitors.</p>


<h4>THE NEW MOON.</h4>

<p>On first seeing the new moon, if you happen to look at it over
your right shoulder, you may make a silent wish, and you will realize
it. If a girl thus observes the new moon, and desires to see her
future husband, she must repeat to herself (so as not to be heard by
any one) the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">New moon, new—pray let me see</div>
<div class="verse">Who my husband is to be:</div>
<div class="verse indent4">The color of his hair,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">The clothes he is to wear,</div>
<div class="verse">And the happy day that he’ll wed me!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>If she is to be married that year, she will positively see the man of
her choice before the wane of the full moon.</p>


<h4>THE KEY AND BOOK CHARM.</h4>

<p>To find out the two first letters of a future wife’s or husband’s
name, take a small Bible and the key of your front street-door, and
having opened to Solomon’s Songs, chap. viii., ver. 6 and 7, place the
wards of the key on those two verses, and let the bow of the key<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
be about an inch out of the top of the Bible; then shut the book,
and tie it round with your garter, so as the key will not move, and
the person who wishes to know his or her future husband or wife’s
signature, must suspend the Bible, by putting the fore-finger of the
right hand under the bow of the key, and the other person in like
manner on the other side of the bow of the key, who must repeat
the following verses, after the other person’s saying the alphabet,
one letter to each time repeating them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_127.jpg"  alt="Key and book" />
</div>

<p>It must be observed, that you mention to the person who repeats
the verses, before you begin, which you intend to try first, whether
surname or Christian name, and take care to hold the Bible steady;
and when you arrive at the appointed letter, the book will turn round
under your finger, and that you will find to be the first letter of your
intended’s name.</p>

<p class="center">Solomon’s Songs, chap. viii., ver. 6 and 7.</p>

<p>"Set me a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm; for
love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave; the coals
thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</p>

<p>“Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown
it; if a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
it would be utterly contemned.”</p>


<h4>CARD CHARM.</h4>

<p>Draw all the face cards from the pack and put them into your stocking
on a Friday night, placing the stocking under your pillow. You
must find out by the Almanac the precise time the sun rises on Saturday
morning, and at that moment draw a card. A king denotes a
speedy marriage; a queen means delay or celibacy; a Jack is a gay
seducer who will give you trouble. Diamonds are riches, hearts
true love, spades thrift, and clubs poverty.</p>


<h4>THE SPIDER OMEN.</h4>

<p>It is considered an ill omen when one sees a spider <i>in the morning</i>.
The earlier in the morning, and the larger the spider, the greater the
evil which threatens you. It is <i>within doors</i>, however, and chiefly <i>in
one’s own chamber</i>, that the spider has this signification—out of doors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
they forebode no harm. The <i>wood spider</i> especially, is not much to
be dreaded; what I have said above refers particularly to the <i>house
spider</i>. Never, on any account, kill a wood spider. By such an act
you would only draw upon yourself the hatred of the whole race of
witches, and sooner or later you would suffer from it.</p>

<p>When found <i>in the evening</i>, a spider signifies good luck. The
smaller the spider, the greater the good fortune. I will here teach
you the following rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Matin, chagrin,</div>
  <div class="verse">Soir, espoir.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Little spiders have much less evil in them than the others, and
those called daddy-long-legs are always messengers of good luck.</p>


<h4>THE STRING TOKEN.</h4>

<p>If your shoe-tie or apron string breaks, your sweetheart is thinking
of you.</p>


<h4>SIGN WHEN YOUR RIGHT EAR TINGLES.</h4>

<p>If your <i>right ear</i> tingles, some one is speaking <i>well</i> of you, if the
<i>left ear</i> tingles, some one is speaking <i>ill</i> of you. To find out who
this some one is, you must call out aloud the names of your acquaintance,
one after another. The name at which the tingling ceases is
the name of the person.</p>


<h4>SIGN WHEN TOUR NOSE ITCHES.</h4>

<p>If your nose itches early in the morning, you will on that very
day hear a piece of news.</p>

<h4>STRANGE BED.</h4>

<p>Lay under your pillow a prayer-book, opened at the matrimonial
service, bound round with the garters you wore that day, and a sprig
of myrtle on the page that says  “<i>With this ring I thee wed</i>,” and
your dream will be ominous, and you will have your fortune as well
told as if you had paid a dollar to an astrologer.</p>


<h4>THE SIGN OF A SNEEZE.</h4>

<p>If any one tells you anything, and you are shortly after obliged to
sneeze, you may be sure that what was told you is true.</p>


<h4>THE DEATH-TICK.</h4>

<p>If you hear a wood-tick or death-watch ticking anywhere in the
house, you must try to get rid of it as soon as possible, or you will
speedily hear of a death which will greatly afflict you.</p>


<h4>THE CRICKET.</h4>

<p>If there is a cricket in the house, be careful on no account to disturb
it. Think of Dickens’ <i>Cricket on the Hearth</i>.</p>


<h4>AN OMEN OF RICHES.</h4>

<p>When an <i>ant-heap</i> gathers in your house, it signifies <i>coming wealth</i>—you
may, however, destroy the nest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>


<h4>THE FROG PROGNOSTIC.</h4>

<p>If the first <i>frog</i> that you see in the spring of the year is sitting
upon <i>dry ground</i>, it signifies that, during the same year, you will
shed as many tears as the frog would require to swim away in.</p>


<h4>THE CANDLE TOKEN.</h4>

<p>When a large red token forms in the flame of a candle-wick, it
signifies that the one who first sees it will soon receive a letter.</p>


<h4>THE STAR AUGURY.</h4>

<p>When you are out of doors on a starlit evening, and shooting stars
appear, turn your face upward to the stars, and utter in a whisper
the wish nearest your heart. If a star shoots while you do this, you
may be sure that the wish will be fulfilled.</p>


<h4>HOW TO BE SURE OF A PARTNER AT A DANCE.</h4>

<p>When you wish to be sure of many partners at a dance or ball,
let a little brother or sister, or any other person <i>hold a thumb for
you</i>—that is, keep her hand closed like a fist for a quarter of an
hour, holding her <i>thumb</i> between the <i>fore</i> and <i>middle finger</i>, while
she thinks of you, and wishes you good luck. This proceeding has
a wonderful effect.</p>


<h4>THE BRIDE’S OMEN.</h4>

<p>If you would have fair weather on your wedding day, you must
always faithfully feed the cats. It is true it is a common error when
persons think that it forebodes evil when it rains upon the bride
<i>in her bridal dress</i>. This is no evil omen, but the contrary. But,
above all things, let her be careful not to allow her <i>shoes to get wet</i>.
If my young readers would take the trouble to read Frederika Bremer’s
work called  “The House,” they would find in it a confirmation
of this warning.</p>


<h4>TO KNOW IF A WOMAN WITH CHILD WILL HAVE A GIRL
OR BOY.</h4>

<p>Write the proper names of the father and the mother, and of the
month she conceived with child, and likewise adding all the numbers
of those letters together, divide them by seven; and then, if the remainder
be even, it will be a girl, if uneven, it will be a boy.</p>


<h4>THE CROW SIGN.</h4>

<p>If you wish to know how matters will go with you during the
year, you must take good heed of the first <i>crow</i> that you see in the
spring. If, when you first see it, it is <i>flying</i>, it signifies that you
will take a journey that will be longer or shorter, according to the
distance which the bird flies before it alights. It may also signify a
complete <i>change of abode</i>, perhaps by a wedding. If you first see the
bird <i>sitting</i>, you will remain at home; if <i>cawing</i>, much that you do
not think of will happen to you; if upon <i>one leg</i>, fortune will not
smile upon you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>


<h4>THE RABBIT AUGURY.</h4>

<p>If, when in the open field, or upon the highroad, a <i>rabbit runs
across your path</i>, it signifies that something <i>unpleasant</i> will happen
to you.</p>


<h4>THE SHEEP AND SWINE TOKEN.</h4>

<p>If you are going to pay a visit, and you meet with <i>sheep</i>, you will be
very <i>welcome</i>; but if you meet with <i>swine</i>, you will be <i>unwelcome</i>.</p>


<h4>A CHARM AGAINST NIGHTMARE.</h4>

<p>If you wish to be secure against the nightmare in your sleep, place
your shoes side by side upon the floor, at the foot of the bed, so that
the toes will point <i>not</i> toward the bed, but in the contrary direction,
as if they were <i>going from it</i>.</p>


<h4>WHAT A SPIDER WEB FORETELLS.</h4>

<p>If you are walking with a young man at a time when the so-called
gossamer, those snow-white spider’s threads, are floating about
in the air, and one of these delicate fibrous veils sweeps by, <i>and forms
a band between you and him</i>, it is a sign that feelings of a tender nature
will some day bind you to each other.</p>


<h4>HOW TO GET A SWEETHEART.</h4>

<p>If a thick, long spider’s web hangs anywhere from the ceiling, you
must sweep it down as soon as possible, for it signifies a <i>suitor</i>, and
the one that gets the web will have him.</p>


<h4>WHAT A PRICK IN THE FINGER SIGNIFIES.</h4>

<p>If you are sewing upon a new dress, apron, &amp;c., &amp;c., and you prick
your finger with the needle so as to bring blood, it is a sign that
when you first wear the garment you will receive many kisses.</p>


<h4>EASTER WATER.</h4>

<p>In speaking of a love potion, I made mention of <i>Easter water</i>;
many of my readers have, I suppose, never heard of this singular
kind of water. I will explain it to you. It is water which is
drawn from the river upon Easter morning, before the sun has shone
upon it. To obtain it, therefore, you must rise on Easter morning
while it is still quite dark, take your way to the river in silence,
fill your pitcher in silence, and then make your way home in silence,
without looking behind you. You may then go to bed again and
have your sleep out. This Easter water has this peculiarity: <i>it will
keep sweet throughout the whole year</i>. You can, therefore, fill as many
bottles with it as you please, cork them tightly, and lay them away.
Besides its use in the above-named love potion, it is beneficial in various
maladies, especially in diseases of the eye, and, in addition to
this, it is an approved cosmetic.</p>


<h4>THE RYE CHARM.</h4>

<p>If you would have bread and cake in plenty during the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
year, hang a full sheaf of rye and a full sheaf of wheat upon a pole
outside the door, on Christmas morning, so that the birds may come
and feed from it.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>NUMEROUS METHODS OF TELLING FORTUNES ON NEW YEAR’S EYE.</h3>

<p>The evening which of all others is the most adapted for witchery,
is New Year’s eve. It is a very ill practice to spend this evening <i>at
a ball</i>, and it is an acknowledged fact that ill luck, more or less, follows
a person throughout the year, who has <i>danced the old year out
and the new year in</i>.</p>

<p>You should spend New Year’s eve with a small circle of near and
dear friends, around a punch-bowl, while you seek to inquire what
the future has in store for you. In the first place this may be done
with <i>melted lead or wax</i>. Some of you, perhaps, are acquainted with
this method of inquiring of the future, yet there may be many among
your number who are still ignorant of it. Now, as it is of the highest
interest in the world that these should know the process, I will
here give, for their benefit, a short explanation of it, which the others
may skip over.</p>


<h4>THE LEAD AND WAX SPELL.</h4>

<p>Take a good-sized piece of lead or wax, (the former is better,)
place it in a melting-ladle, and dissolve it over the coals, or over a
spirit-lamp, into which you have poured a little alcohol. You must
then take a vessel full of water, (a bowl is best, that is not too deep
nor too shallow,) and pour into it the lead or wax, and from the various
figures which it forms in the water you endeavor to tell your
fortune.</p>


<h4>THE SAUCER CHARM.</h4>

<p>The following is another method: you take four saucers; in one
you put a <i>ring</i>, in another a <i>sprig of myrtle</i>, in the third a <i>piece of
money</i>, and in the fourth <i>nothing</i>. The individuals composing the
company must now walk around the table, blindfold, one after the
other, and choose one of the saucers, which, in the mean time, have
been changed as to place. Those among the company who choose
the ring, will be <i>betrothed</i> in the course of the year; <i>myrtle</i> signifies
wedlock, the <i>piece of money wealth</i>, the <i>empty saucer</i> no change of circumstances.</p>


<h4>HOW TO TELL THE FIRST LETTER OF YOUR FUTURE
WIFE OR HUSBAND’S NAME.</h4>

<p>If you wish to know the letter with which your future wife or
husband’s name commences, write all the letters of the alphabet,
separately, upon small pieces of paper, put these pieces in a box, and
draw one out blindfold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>All this may be done before twelve o’clock. Exactly at the stroke
of midnight, however, you can summon up your future husband or
wife, and behold his or her image <i>up the chimney</i>.</p>


<h4>THE CANDLE SPELL.</h4>

<p>The following is another method: Take <i>two candles</i>, go a little before
twelve o’clock into an adjoining chamber—no one on any account
must follow you—place yourself before the <i>mirror</i>, and exactly as it
strikes <i>twelve</i>, call out your own name in full, <i>three times</i>. When the
last sound has died away, you will see in the glass your future husband
looking over your shoulder.</p>

<p>The company may not remain together after twelve o’clock. When
the old year is out and the new year in, you must embrace, and kiss
each other, and then go home. You must not yet go to bed, however,
but must first devote an hour to solitude, to reflect upon all
which the past year has brought with it, and to commit to writing
the chief occurrences, as well as the state of your minds. It would
be well to keep a book for this purpose, in which you should read
and write only on a new-year’s eve, and at other times keep carefully
stored away. I have always done this, and I can assure you, that it
is with a feeling of sad, sweet interest, that I now read, each new-year’s
eve, of the eighty-nine years of my life.</p>


<h4>THE NUTSHELL WITCHERY.</h4>

<p>Among the witcheries which you may perform on a new-year’s eve,
there is one to which I have not alluded. Each person of the company,
to wit, takes a <i>nutshell</i>, and, after lighting a <i>wax taper</i>, places
it in the shell. A basin of water is then brought. You now place
the nutshells, with the burning tapers in them, in the basin. Some
will incline toward each other as they float along, others will repel
each other, until, at last, all are extinguished or sunk. What conclusions
in reference to the future, are to be drawn from the various
movements of these tiny magic skiffs, your own quick wits will tell
you.</p>


<h4>THE BRIDGE OMEN.</h4>

<p>After you have gone home, and have devoted an hour to the solitary
task which I counselled you (see <span class="smcap">Candle Spell</span>), take a <i>glass of
water</i>, cut a small <i>chip of wood</i>, and lay it crosswise upon the glass, so
that it stretches like a bridge, from one end to the opposite one. Then
place this glass under your bed. The consequence will be that you
will dream during the night that you are walking over a bridge, and
that you fall into the water. A gentleman, however, appears and
rescues you. This same gentleman, whom you will see very distinctly,
be careful to remember, for he is your future husband. A gentleman
can make the same experiment, and he will dream the same thing,
with the difference only, that it is a lady who rescues him, and she is
to be his future wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>


<h4>THE HAIR SPELL.</h4>

<p>If you wish any person to think of you, pluck a hair from your
head, and blow it out into the air toward that quarter of the heavens
in which the person lives, while, at the same time, you call out the
name of this person <i>three times</i>, at the top of your voice. During this
you must be entirely alone, and must have thought intently upon the
person for, at least, a quarter of an hour beforehand. At the same
instant he will experience a strange unearthly shudder or thrill, and
his thoughts will turn irresistibly toward you.</p>


<h4>SIGN WHEN YOU WET YOUR APRON.</h4>

<p>When you are washing, if you are apt <i>to wet your apron</i> a great
deal, it is a sign that your future husband will be a tippler. Take
good heed therefore!</p>


<h4>THE NAIL TOKEN.</h4>

<p>If a person has nails that are all bitten to pieces, and gnawed close
to the quick, it signifies an evil, malicious character, and you have
every reason in the world to be on your guard in your intercourse
with such a person.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="HOW_TO_DETERMINE_THE_LUCKY"></a>HOW TO DETERMINE THE LUCKY AND
THE UNLUCKY DAYS OF ANY MONTH
IN THE YEAR.</h2>

<p>Ascertain from the Almanac the day on which a full moon occurs,
and count the number of days from that to the end of the month: you
then multiply the number of days in the month by the number ascertained
as above, and the total will give you the lucky days (subject to
a further test hereafter explained), which must be reckoned this wise:
if the total happens to be, say 516, the lucky days of that month
would be the 5th and 16th, and if it should be 561, the days are the
same, for you must always transpose the figures, when they will work
together. Suppose that instead of 516, the total should be 399; as
neither of these figures can be paired, the lucky days from that total
are the 3d and 9th, and the 9th would be considered doubly lucky, if
no tests worked to the contrary.</p>

<p>The unlucky days are determined in precisely the same manner, by
multiplying the number of days in the month by the number which
had passed previous to a full moon.</p>

<p>After working out your list of lucky days, in the manner above
described, you must then test them, in order to be sure that there
are no opposing influences. You can do this by calculating the unlucky
days. Should you find that any day of the month which was
designated as lucky came also in the list of unlucky days, the latter
preponderates, and you must strike it from the lucky list.</p>

<p>This plan of demonstrating lucky and unlucky days is very ancient,
and has been tested to such an extent that it is considered accurate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
by most astrologers. In old times, before the mass of the people
understood much about figures, the professional fortune-tellers demanded
a large fee for casting the lucky days of any month, which
they accomplished in the manner above described.</p>

<p>Lucky marriage days for girls were cast in the same manner, except
that the age of the girl was used as the multiplicator, or multiplier,
instead of the number of days in the month. The result was determined
similarly, and also by a test of the unlucky days. Thus, if a
girl is 18 years old, and thinks of marrying in October, she takes up
an Almanac and ascertains the day of the full moon in that month.
It occurs on the 24th, and there are 31 days in the month: this
leaves 7 for the multiplier. She multiplies this by her age, 18, and
the result is 106, which shows the lucky days in that month for her
to marry are the 10th and 6th, unless they are destroyed by the test,
which is determined as follows: There are 23 days before the 24th,
and she must multiply 23 by 18, which gives 414, and shows that
the 4th and 14th are the only unlucky days for her to marry; and as
they do not conflict with the lucky days, the 6th and 10th may be
considered as genuine lucky days for that month, reckoning the moon
to have fulled on the 24th. In determining her age, she should
reckon any period over half a year a full year.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_DIVINING_ROD"></a>THE DIVINING ROD:<br />

<small>OR, HOW TO TELL WHERE TO DIG FOR WATER AND ALL
KINDS OF METALS.</small></h2>

<p>So early as Agricola, a celebrated conjuror who lived in ancient
times, the divining rod was in much request, and has obtained great
credit for its discovering where to dig for metals and springs of water;
for some years past its reputation has been upon the decline, but
lately it has been revived, and with great success, as I have myself
found from numerous experiments that its effects are more than imagination,
and to enable others to do the like, I have laid down some
short rules, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Directions for choosing Rods.</span> The hazel and willow rods, I
have by experience found, will actually answer with all persons who
are in a good state of health, if they are used with moderation, and
at some distance of time, after meals, when the operator is in good
spirits. The hazel, willow, and elm are all attracted by springs of
water. Some persons have the virtue intermittently; the rod in
their hands will attract one half hour, and repel the next. The rod
is attracted by water, all metals, coals, amber, and lime-stone, but
with different degrees of strength.</p>

<p>The best rods are those from the hazel, or nut-tree, as they are pliant
and rough, and are best cut in the winter months; a shoot that
terminates equally forked is to be preferred, (<i>See Fig. 1</i>,) about two
feet and a half long; but as such a fork is rarely to be met with, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
single ones of a length, and size may be tied together with thread, and
they will answer as well as the others. (<i>See Fig. 2.</i>)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_135a.jpg"  alt="Fig. 1 and Fig. 2" />
</div>

<p>The most convenient and handy method of holding the rod is with
the palms of the hands turned upward, and the two ends of the rod
coming outward; the palms should be held horizontally as nearly as
possible; the part of the rod in the hands ought to be straight, and
not bent either backward or forward; the upper part of the arm
should be kept pretty close to the sides, and the elbows resting on
them, the lower part of the arm making nearly a right angle with the
upper, though rather a little more acute; the rod ought to be so held
that, in its working, the sides may move clear of the little fingers.
The position of the rod, when properly held, is much like the following
figure, (<i>see Fig. 3</i>,) where the distance between the four downward
lines is the part supposed to be held in the hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_135.jpg"  alt="Fig. 3" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>The best manner of carrying the rod is with the end prolaided in
an angle of about eighty degrees from the horizon, as by this method
of carrying, the repulsion is more plainly perceived than if it was held
perpendicularly. But after all the directions that can be given, the
adroit use of it can only be attained by practice. It is necessary that
the grasp should be steady, for if, when the rod is going, there should
be the least succession or counteraction in the hands, though ever so
small, it will greatly impair, and generally totally prevent its activity,
which is not to be done by the mere strength of the grasp, for provided
this be steady, no strength can stop it.</p>

<p>As soon as the person’s foremost foot comes near the attracting
body, the end of the rod is repelled toward the face. (<i>See Fig. 4.</i>)
Then open the hands a little, replace the rod, and approach nearer,
and the repulsion will be continued until the foot is on or over the
attracting body. When this is the case, the rod will first be repelled
a little, viz., two or three inches, and then be attracted toward it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_136.jpg"  alt="Fig. 4" />
</div>

<p>When it hath been drawn down, it must not be thrown back without
opening the hands, a fresh grasp being necessary to every attraction,
but the least opening of the hand is sufficient. As long as the
person stands over the attracting body, the rod continues to be attracted,
but as soon as the fore foot is beyond it, then the rod is
drawn down backward to the face. Metals have different degrees of
attraction: gold is strongest, next copper, then iron, silver, tin, lead,
bones, coals, springs of water and lime-stone. To make common experiments,
set the foot on a piece or coin of any of these metals, having
the rod in your hands as before directed. In using the rod to
discover springs and metals, let the person hold the rod as already
directed, and then advancing north or south with a slow pace, just
one foot before the other, at first the rod may be repelled, but as the
person advances slowly, and comes over the spring, or vein of ore,
the rod will be strongly attracted. The divining rod is sometimes
called <i>Divina Virgula</i>, and sometimes <i>The Luck Rod</i>.</p>

either as a statesman, soldier, physician, or clergyman.</p>

<p>28. A child born upon this day will live to be a rich and truly
good man if born before noon, but if born after that hour, it is to be
feared that he will be dissipated or worthless.</p>

rest assured they will never be fulfilled. Never buy a lottery ticket
on this day.</p>

<h2><a id="SIGNIFICATION_OR_LANGUAGE_OF_THE_FLOWERS"></a>SIGNIFICATION OR LANGUAGE OF THE
FLOWERS.</h2>

<p>No Book on Fortune-telling and Dreams would be complete without
the signification of the flowers. If we dream of, or have those
smiles of nature given to us, we should at once consult the language
of Flora and ascertain what our dream or present signifies.</p>

<p>It is no new thing to attach a sentiment or meaning to each flower.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
In Eastern lands flowers have a language which all understand. It
is that  “still small voice” which is powerful on account of its silence.
It is one of the chief amusements of the Greek girls to drop these
symbols of their esteem or scorn upon the various passengers who
pass their latticed windows, and the traveller can read upon Egyptian
rocks accounts of the conquests of that ancient people recorded by
foreign plants. Accompanying, we give a complete dictionary of the
meaning of the flowers.</p>

high, the forehead short, hard, and peaked, with bristly hair, large
feet, rather thick than broad, a harsh unequal voice, and choleric
complexion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weakness of Body</span> is distinguished by a small ill-proportioned
head, narrow shoulders, soft skin, and melancholy complexion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The signs of Long life</span> are strong teeth, a sanguine temperament,
middle stature, large, deep, and ruddy lines in the hand, large muscles,
stooping shoulders, full chest, firm flesh, clear complexion, slow
growth, wide ears, and large eyelids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Short Life</span> may be inferred from a thick tongue; the appearance
of grinders before the age of puberty, thin, straggling and uneven
teeth, confused lines in the hand, of a quick but small growth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Good Genius</span> may be expected from a thin skin, middle stature,
blue bright eyes, fair complexion, straight, pretty strong hair, an
affable aspect, the eyebrows joined, moderation in mirth, an open,
cheerful countenance, and the temples a little concave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Dunce</span> may be known by a swollen neck, plump arms, sides,
and loins, a round head, concave behind, a large fleshy forehead, pale
eyes, a dull heavy look, small joints, snuffing nostrils, and a proneness
to laughter, little hands, an ill-proportioned head, either too big
or too little, blubber lips, short fingers, and thick legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fortitude</span> is promised from a wide mouth, a sonorous voice, grave,
slow, and always equal, upright posture, large eyes, pretty open and
steadfast, the hair high above the forehead, the head much compressed
or flattened, the forehead square and high, the extremities large and
robust, the neck firm though not fleshy, a large corpulent chest, and
brown complexion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boldness</span> is characterized by a prominent mouth, rugged appearance,
rough forehead, arched eyebrows, large nostrils and teeth, short
neck, great arms, ample chest, square shoulders and a forward countenance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> is generally distinguished by a head which is flat on the
sides, a broad square forehead, a little concave in the middle, a soft
voice, a large chest, a thin hair, light eyes, either blue, brown or
black, large eyes, and an aquiline nose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A good Memory</span> is commonly attached to those persons who are
smaller, yet better formed in the upper than the lower parts, not fat
but fleshy, of a fair, delicate skin, with the poll of the head uncovered,
crooked nose, teeth thick set, large ears with plenty of cartilage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A bad Memory</span> is observable in persons who are larger in their
superior than inferior parts, fleshy, though dry and bald.—N. B.
This is expressly contrary to the opinion of Aristotle, who says
that the superior parts being larger than the inferior signify a good
memory, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A good Imagination and thoughtful Disposition</span> is distinguished
by a large prominent forehead, a fixed and attentive look, slow respiration,
and an inclination of the head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A good Sight</span> is enjoyed by those persons who have generally
black, thick, straight eye-lashes, large bushy eyebrows, concave eyes,
contracted as it were inwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Short-sighted People</span> have a stern, earnest look, small, short eyebrows,
large pupils and prominent eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sense of Hearing</span>: those who possess the same in perfection, have
ears well furnished with gristle, well channelled and hairy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sense of Smelling</span> is most perfect in those who have large
noses, descending very near the mouth, neither too moist nor too dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A nice Faculty of Tasting</span> is peculiar to such as have a spongy,
porous, soft tongue, well moistened with saliva, yet not too moist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delicacy in the Touch</span> belongs to those who have a soft skin,
sensible nerves, and nervous sinews, moderately warm and dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irascibility</span> is accompanied by an erect posture, a clear skin, a
solemn voice, open nostrils, moist temples, displaying superficial
veins, thick neck, equal use of both hands, quick pace, blood-shot
eyes, large, unequal, ill-ranged eyes, and choleric disposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timorousness</span> resides where we find a concave neck, pale color,
weak-winking eyes, soft hair, smooth plump breast, shrill tremulous
voice, small mouth, thin lips, broad thin hands, and small shambling
feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Melancholy</span> is denoted by a wrinkled countenance, dejected eyes,
meeting eyebrows, slow pace, fixed look, and deliberate respiration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Amorous Disposition</span> may be known by a fair, slender
face, a redundancy of hair, rough temples, broad forehead, moist
shining eyes, wide nostrils, narrow shoulders, hairy hands and arms,
well-shaped legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gayety</span> attends a serene open forehead, rosy agreeable countenance,
a sweet musical tone of voice, an agile body and soft flesh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Envy</span> appears with a wrinkled forehead, frowning, dejected, and
squinting look, a pale, melancholy countenance, and a dry, rough
skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span> often resides in a small body, with red curled hair,
ruddy countenance, frowning eyebrows, arched and meeting, eyes
blue and yellowish, large mouth, and red lines in the hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleness and Complacency</span> may be distinguished by a soft and
moist palm, frequency of shutting the eyes, soft movement, slow
speech, soft, straight and lightish-colored hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bashfulness</span> may be discovered by moist eyes, never wide open,
eyebrows frequently lowered, blushing cheeks, moderate pace, slow
and submissive speech, bent body, and glowing ears of a purple hue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Temperance or Sobriety</span> is accompanied with an equal respiration,
a moderate-sized mouth, smooth temples, eyes of an ordinary
size, either fair or azure, and a short, flat body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strength of Mind</span> is signified by light, curled hair, a small body,
shining eyes, but a little depressed, a grave intense voice, bushy
beard, large broad back and shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pride</span> stands confessed with arched eyebrows, a large prominent
mouth, a broad chest, slow pace, erected head, shrugging shoulders,
and staring eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luxury</span> dwells with a ruddy or pale complexion, downy temples,
bald pate, little eyes, thick neck, corpulent body, large nose, thin
eyebrows, and hands covered with a kind of down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loquacity</span> may be expected from a bushy beard, broad fingers,
pointed tongue, eyes of a ruddy hue, a large prominent upper lip,
and a sharp pointed nose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perverseness</span> may be dreaded, when we perceive a high forehead,
firm, short, thick, immovable neck, quick speech, immoderate laughter,
fiery eyes, and short fleshy hands and fingers.</p>

that such an immense and varied amount of matter could be crowded
into a book of the merely nominal price of a dollar and a half; but the work
contains 436 large pages of small type, closely printed in double column, and a
perusal of it will convince the most skeptical that the only thing to be wondered
at in it, is the extremely low price at which it is offered.

<p class="pt"><b>Dick’s Mysteries of the Hand; or, Palmistry made Easy.</b>
Translated, Abridged and Arranged from the French Works of Desbarrolles,
D’Arpentigny and De Para d’Hermes. This book is a concise summary of
the elaborate works of the above-named authorities on Palmistry.</p>

<p>The various lines and mounts on the palm of the hand, and the typical
formation of the hand and fingers are all clearly explained and illustrated
by diagrams. The meaning to be deduced from the greater or less development
of these mounts and lines (each of which has its own signification),
also from the length, thickness and shape of the thumb and fingers, and
from the mutual bearing they exercise on each other, is all distinctly
explained.</p>

<p>Complete facility for instant reference is insured by means of marginal notes
by which any point of detail may be found and consulted at a glance.</p>

<p>By means of this book the hitherto occult mystery of Palmistry is made
simple and easy, and the whole Art may be acquired without difficulty or
delay. It is emphatically Palmistry in a nutshell, and by its use, character
and disposition can be discerned and probable future destiny foretold
with surprising accuracy.<br />

among the best specimens of broad burlesque to which the genius of the
ludicrous, for which the Southwest is so distinguished, has yet given birth.
